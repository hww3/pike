How to create Pike modules
==========================

o You need a name for your module, for our purposes, let us assume you 
   want to create the module "modulen".

o Create the dir src/modules/modulen

o Copy the Makefile.in from src/modules/Gz and modify it.
  Set the macro OBJS to all objectfiles in your module.
  Set the macro MODULE_LDFLAGS to all needed -L<libdir> -R<libdir>
  options followed by all needed -l<lib> options.
  If you want your module to always be linked statically, modify
  @dynamic_module_makefile@ to @static_module_makefile@.
  The Makefile.in need not contain any dependencies.

o You need a testsuite.in, even if it is just an empty one.

o You need a configure.in
  Your configure.in should test for ALL features you need.
  Your configure.in should contain the line
	sinclude(../module_configure.in)
  Do not trust the global configure tests to do things for you.

o All C/C++ files should include "global.h" as the first included file.

o When building the your module the first time you need to:
  1) run autoconf
  2) do 'make depend' from your build dir
  3) re-run configure from your build dir
  4) make (in your build dir)
