o You need a name for your module, for our purposes, let us assume you 
   want to create the module "modulen".

o Create the dir src/modules/modulen

o Copy the Makefile.src from src/modules/files and modify it.
  The Makefile.src need not contain any dependencies.

o You need a testsuite.in, even if it is just an empty one.

o You want a doc dir with BMML or HTML documenation.

o You need a configure.in
  Your configure.in should test for ALL features you need.
  Do not trust the global configure tests to do things for you.

o All c/c++ files should include "global.h"

o The makefile should create a file called linker_options in the build dir
  that contains the needed -l<lib> directives.

o When building the your module the first time you need to:
  1) run autoconf
  2) do 'make depend' from your build dir
  3) re-run configure from your build dir
  4) make (in your build dir)
