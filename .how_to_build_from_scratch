Glad you found this file :)

The toplevel makefile (in this directory, not the src directory)
has all the magic you need to build pike directly from CVS. Just
type 'make'.

You will need autoconf, automake, gnu m4, bison, a C compiler
and the GMP library. You probably also want to use GNU make and
libz.







If that doesn't work, or you like making things difficult for yourself,
try the Old instructions:

After checking out the files from CVS you will notice that some files
are missing compared to a regular distribution... To bootstrap your
Pike development environment you must do the following steps:

1) cd src ; ./run_autoconfig
	This creates configure files and Makefile.in files.

2) Create a build directory an cd to it
	Do NOT build in the source dir, doing so will make it impossible
	to do 'make export' later.

3) Run the newly created configure file located in the src dir from the
   build dir. Make sure to use an absolute path!
	This creates the Makefiles you need.
	If you don't use an absolute path the debug information will
	be all warped...

4) 'make depend'
	This updates all the Makefile.in files in the source dir to
	contain the correct dependencies

5) If needed, modify your Makefile
	(Normally never needed)

6) 'make'
	This builds pike.

After doing this, DO NOT, commit the generated files. They are placed in
.cvsignore files so you shouldn't have to bother with them.
Doing 'make export' will create a tar file with all the needed files,
but they should NOT be in the CVS archive!
