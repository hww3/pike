Glad you found this file :)

After checking out the files from CVS you will notice that some files
are missing compared to a regular distribution... To bootstrap your
Pike development environment you must ddo the following steps:

1) cd src ; ./run_autoconfig
	This creates configure files and Makefile.in files.

2) Create a build directory an cd to it
	Do not build in the source dir, doing so will make it impossible
	to do 'make export' later.

3) run the newly created configure file located in the src dir from the
   build dir. Make sure to use an absolute path!
	This creates the Makefiles you need.
	If you don't use an absolute path the debug information will
	be all warped...

4) 'make depend'
	This updates all the Makefile.in files in the source dir to
	contain the correct dependencies

5) run configure again
	This updates your Makefiles to include the dependencies.
	The config.cache file will make this a lot faster.

6) If needed, modify your Makefile

7) 'make'
	This builds pike.
