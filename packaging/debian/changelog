pike7.3 (7.3.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * src/modules/Perl/perlmod.c: Adjustment to work better with Perl
          5.8.0, plus a few minor layout changes to make the code nicer to
          read.
        * lib/modules/Local.pmod: Added support for specifying paths using
          the PIKE_LOCAL_PATH environment variable.
        * src/language.yacc: Fixed typing for intranges with bignum
          intervals.
        * lib/modules/Stdio.pmod/GZipFile.pike: Added basic support for
          reading and writing gzip files.  This is the first version and it
          is still a bit experimental.  Uses Gz._file() for lowlevel support.
        * src/modules/Gz/zlibmod.c: Added basic support for reading and
          writing gzip files.  Lowlevel functions are located in Gz._file().
        * src/builtin_functions.c: Fixed incorrect info about rusage() and
          added a bit more description about some of the items.
        * src/language.yacc: Added the "global" keyword to
          magic_identifiers so it can be used after ->.
        * src/pike_types.c: parse_type() now supports the syntax
          object(this_program), and defaults to implements mode.
        * src/modules/Postgres/: configure.in, pgres_config.h.in,
          postgres.c: this makes the Postgres module detect/work correctly
          with the PostgreSQL 7.2+
