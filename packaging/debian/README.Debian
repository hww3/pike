Notes for developers
--------------------

The postinst script created a few directories in /usr/local which you can
use for your modules/include files. Once created by the postinst script
they will never be touched by any pike package again. The directories
are:

/usr/local/include/pike
/usr/local/include/pike7.7

/usr/local/lib/pike/site_pike
/usr/local/lib/pike7.7/site_pike

/usr/local/share/pike/site_pike
/usr/local/share/pike7.7/site_pike
