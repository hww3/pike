Fink package for Darwin/MacOS X
-------------------------------

Just copy .info files into your /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo directory,
after that, do a "fink index" and then a "fink install pike7.5" if you'd like
to compile and install pike.

It will install the needed dependency like gmp, freetype1, freetype2 etc...

If you'd like to build only the package (for example deploying pike in
thousands of mac), just do a "fink build pike7.5".

NOTE: This fink source file is tested on panther only (OS X 10.3)

As always, any comments and suggestions are welcome.
