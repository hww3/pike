<preface title="Preface">

This book was written with the intention of making anybody with a little
programming experience able to use Pike. It should also be possible to
gain a deep understanding of how Pike works and to some extent why it works
the way it does from this book. It will teach you how to write your own
extensions to Pike. I have been trying for years to get someone else to
write this book, but since it seems impossible without paying a fortune for
it I will have to do it myself. 
A big thanks goes to
<a href="http://www.emit.com.pl/ian.html">Ian Carr-de Avelon</a> and
<a href="mailto:hedda@idonix.se">Henrik Wallin</a>
 for helping
me iron out some of the rough spots. 

The book assumes that
you have programmed some other programming language before and that you
have some experience of UNIX.

<introduction title="Introduction">

This introduction will give you some background about Pike and this book
and also compare Pike with other languages. If you want to start
learning Pike immediately you can skip this chapter.

<section title="Overview">
This book is designed for people who want to
learn Pike fast. Since Pike is a simple language to learn, especially
if you have some prior programming experience, this should benefit most people.
<p>
Chapter one is devoted to background information about Pike and this book.
It is not really necessary to read this chapter to learn how to use and
program Pike, but it might help explain why some things work the way they do.
It might be more interesting to re-read the chapter after you have
learned the basics of Pike programming.
Chapter two is where the action starts. It is a crash course in Pike with
examples and explanations of some of the basics. It explains the
fundamentals of the Pike data types and control structures.
The systematic documentation of all Pike capabilities starts in chapter three
with a description of all control structures in Pike. It then continues with
all the data types in chapter four and operators in chapter five. Chapter
six deals with object orientation in Pike, which is slightly different than
what you might be used to.

<section title="The history of Pike">
In the beginning, there was Zork. Then a bunch of people decided to make
multi-player adventure games. One of those people was Lars Pensjö at the
Chalmers university in Gothenburg, Sweden. For his game he needed a simple,
memory-efficient language, and thus LPC (Lars Pensjö C) was born. About a
year later I started playing one of these games and found that the language
was the most easy-to-use language I had ever encountered. I liked the language
so much that I started improving it and before long I had made my own LPC
dialect called LPC4. LPC4 was still geared towards writing adventure games,
but was quite useful for writing other things with as well. A major problem
with LPC4 was the copyright. Since it was based on Lars Pensjö's code, it
came with a license that did not allow it to be used for commercial gain.
So, in 1994 I started writing µLPC, which was a new but similar LPC interpreter.
I got financial backing from Signum Support AB for writing µLPC. Signum
is a company dedicated to supporting GNU and GPL software and they wanted
to create more GPL software.
<p>
When µLPC became usable, InformationsVävarna AB started using it for
their web-server. Before then, Roxen (then called Spinner) was non-commercial
and written in LPC4. Then in 1996 I started working for InformationsVävarna
developing µLPC for them. We also changed the name of µLPC to Pike to
get a more commercially viable name.

<section title="A comparison with other languages">
<dl>

<dt> Python
<dd> Python is probably the language that is most like Pike. Pike is faster
     and has better object orientation. It also has a syntax similar to
     C++, which makes it more familiar for people who know C++. Python on
     the other hand, has a lot more libraries available.

<dt> C++
<dd> Pike's syntax is almost the same as for C++. A huge difference is that
     Pike is interpreted. This makes the code slower, but reduces compile times
     to almost nothing. For those few applications which require the speed of
     C or C++, it is often easier to write a Pike extension than to write the
     whole thing in C or C++.

<dt> Lisp and Scheme
<dd> Internally Pike has a lot in common with simple interpreted Lisp and
     Scheme implementations. They are all stack based, byte-compiled,
     interpreted languages. Pike is also
     a 'one-cell' language, just like Scheme.

<dt> Pascal
<dd> Pike has nothing in common with Pascal.

<dt> Tcl/Tk
<dd> Pike is similar to Tcl/Tk in intent and they both have good string
     handling. Pike has better data types and is much faster however.
     On the other hand Tcl/Tk has X windows system support.
<!-- The idea from the beginning was similar but the implementation is very different.-->

<section title="What is Pike">

Pike is:
<ul>
<li> A programming language
<li> Object oriented
<li> Interpreted
<li> Fast
<li> Dynamic
<li> High-level
<li> similar to C++
<li> easy to extend
<li> (a fish)
</ul>

Pike has:

</section>

<section title="How to read this manual">
This manual uses a couple of different typefaces to describe different
things:
<dl>
<dt><i>italics</i>
<dd>Italics is used as a placeholder for other things. If it says <i>a word</i>
    in the text it means that you should put your own word there.
<dt><b>bold</b>
<dd>Bold is just used to emphasize that this word is not merely what it sounds
    like. It is actually a <b>term</b>.
<dt><tt>fixed size</tt>
<dd>Fixed size is used to for examples and text directly from the computer.
</dl>
Also, please beware that the word <b>program</b> is also a builtin Pike
data type.

</section>
</introduction>


<chapter title="Getting started">
<p>
First you need to have Pike installed on your computer. See <ref to=install>
 if this is not already done. It is also vital
for the first of the following examples that the Pike binary is in your UNIX search
path. If you have problems with this, consult the manual for your shell
or go buy a beginners book about UNIX.
<p>

<section title="Your first Pike program">

<example language=pike>
	int main()
	{
	  write("hello world\n");
	  return 0;
	}
</example>
Let's call this file hello_world.pike, and then we try to run it:
<p>
<pre>
	$ pike hello_world.pike
	hello world
	$ 
</pre>
Pretty simple, Let's see what everything means:
<example language=pike>
	int main()
</example>
This begins the function <tt>main</tt>. Before the function name the type of value
it returns is declared, in this case <tt>int</tt> which is the name of the
integer number type in Pike. The empty space between the
parenthesis indicates that this function takes no arguments.
A Pike program has to contain at least one function, the <tt>main</tt> function. This function is where program execution starts and thus the function from which every other function is called, directly or indirectly. We can say that this function is called by the operating system.
Pike is, as many other programming languages, built upon the concept of functions, i.e. what the program does is separated into small portions, or functions, each performing one (perhaps very complex) task. A function declaration consists of certain essential components; the type of the value it will return, the <i>name</i> of the function, the <i>parameters</i>, if any, it takes and the body of the function. A function is also a part of something greater; an object. You can program in Pike without caring about objects, but the programs you write will in fact be objects themselves anyway.
Now let's examine the body of <tt>main</tt>;
<p>
<example language=pike>
	{
	  write("hello world\n");
	  return 0;
	}
</example>
Within the function body, programming instructions, statements, are grouped together in blocks. A block is a series of statements placed between curly brackets. Every statement has to end in a semicolon. This group of statements will
be executed every time the function is called.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	write("hello world\n");
</example>
The first statement is a call to the builtin function <tt>write</tt>. This will
execute the code in the function <tt>write</tt> with the arguments as input data.
In this case, the constant string <tt>hello world\n</tt> is sent.
Well, not quite. The <tt>\n</tt> combination corresponds to the newline
character.
<tt>write</tt> then writes this string to stdout when executed. Stdout is the standard Unix output channel, usually the screen.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	return 0;
</example>
This statement exits the function and returns the value zero. Any statements
following the return statements will not be executed.
<p>
</section>


<section title="Improving hello_world.pike">
Typing <tt>pike hello_world.pike</tt> to run our program may seem a bit
unpractical. Fortunately, Unix provides us with a way of automating this
somewhat. If we modify hello_world.pike to look like this:
<p>
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike

	int main()
	{
	  write("hello world\n");
	  return 0;
	}
</example>
And then we tell UNIX that hello_world.pike is executable so we can run
hello_world.pike without having to bother with running Pike:
<p>
<pre>
	$ chmod +x hello_world.pike
	$ ./hello_world.pike
	hello world
	$ 
</pre>
N.B.: The hash bang (#!) must be first in the file, not even whitespace is allowed to precede it!
The file name after the hash bang must also be the complete file name to the Pike binary, and it may not exceed 30 characters.
<p>

</section>

<section title="Further improvements">

Now, wouldn't it be nice if it said <tt>Hello world!</tt> instead of <tt>hello world</tt> ?
But of course we don't want to make our program "incompatible" with the old
version. Someone might need the program to work like it used to. 
Therefore we'll add a <i>command line option</i> that will make it type the old
<tt>hello world</tt>. We also have to give the program the ability to choose
what it should output based on the command line option.
This is what it could look like:
<p>
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike

	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  if(argc &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; argv[1]=="--traditional")
	  {
	    write("hello world\n"); // old style
	  }else{
	    write("Hello world!\n"); // new style
	  }
	  return 0;
	}
</example>
Let's run it:
<p>
<pre>
	$ chmod +x hello_world.pike
	$ ./hello_world.pike
	Hello world!
	$ ./hello_world.pike --traditional
	hello world
	$ 
</pre>
What is new in this version, then?
<example language=pike>
	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
</example>
In this version the space between the parenthesis has been filled.
What it means is that <tt>main</tt> now takes two arguments.
One is called <tt>argc</tt>, and is of the type <tt>int</tt>.
The other is called <tt>argv</tt> and is a an array of strings.
<p>
The arguments to <tt>main</tt> are taken from the command line when the
Pike program is executed. The first argument, <tt>argc</tt>, is how many
words were written on the command line (including the command itself) and
<tt>argv</tt> is an array formed by these words.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  if(argc &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; argv[1] == "--traditional")
	  {
	    write("hello world\n"); // old style
	  }else{
	    write("Hello world!\n"); // new style
	  }
</example>
This is an if-else statement, it will execute what's between the first set
of brackets if the expression between the parenthesis evaluate to something
other than zero. Otherwise what's between the second set of brackets will
be executed. Let's look at that expression:
<p>
<example language=pike>
	argc &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; argv[1] == "--traditional"
</example>
Loosely translated, this means: argc is greater than one,  and the second
element in the array argv is equal to the string <tt>--traditional</tt>. Since
argc is the number of words on the command line the first part is true only
if there was anything after the program invocation.
<p>
Also note the comments:
<p>
<example language=pike>
	    write("hello world\n"); // old style
</example>
The <tt>//</tt> begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
Comments will be ignored by the computer when it reads the code.
This allows to inform whoever might read your code (like yourself) of
what the program does to make it easier to understand.
Comments are also allowed to look like C-style comments, i.e. <tt>/* ... */</tt>, which can extend over several lines. The <tt>//</tt> comment only extends to the end of the line.
<p>
</section>

<section title="Control structures">
The first thing to understand about Pike is that just like any other
programming language it executes one piece of code at a time. Most of
the time it simply executes code line by line working its way downwards.
Just executing a long list of instructions is not enough to make an interesting
program however. Therefore we have <b>control structures</b> to make Pike
execute pieces of code in more interesting orders than from top to bottom.
<p>
We have already seen an example of the <tt>if</tt> statement:
<example language=pike meta=expression,statement1,statement2>
	if( expression )
	   statement1;
	else
	   statement2;
</example>
<!-- FIX ME: should if have a capital letter or not? -->
<tt>if</tt> simply evaluates the expression and if the result is true it
executes <i>statement1</i>, otherwise it executes <i>statement2</i>. If you have no need for
statement2 you can leave out the whole else<!-- FIX ME: tt/italics --> part like this:
<example language=pike meta=expression,statement1>
	if( expression )
	  statement1;
</example>
In this case <i>statement1</i> is evaluated if <i>expression</i> is true, otherwise
nothing is evaluated.
<p>
<b>Note for beginners: go back to our first example and make sure you
   understand what <tt>if</tt> does.</b>
<p>
Another very simple control structure is the <tt>while</tt> statement:
<example language=pike meta=expression,statemente>
	while( expression )
	  statement;
</example>
This statement evaluates <i>expression</i> and if it is found to be true it
evaluates <i>statement</i>. After that it starts over and evaluates <i>expression</i>
again. This continues until <i>expression</i> is no longer true. This type of
control structure is called a <b>loop </b> and is fundamental to all
interesting programming.
<p>
</section>

<section title="Functions">
Another control structure we have already seen is the function.
A function is simply a block of Pike code that can be executed with different arguments from different places in the program.
A function is declared like this:
<example language=pike meta=modifiers,type,varname1,varname2,statements>
	modifiers type name(type varname1, type varname2, ...)
	{
	  statements
	}
</example>
The <i>modifiers</i> are optional. See <ref to=modifiers> for more details about
modifiers. The <i>type </i> specifies what kind of data the function returns.
For example, the word <tt>int</tt> would signify that the function returns
an integer number. The <i>name </i> is used to identify the function when
calling it. The names between the parenthesis are the arguments to the
function. They will be defined as local variables inside the function. Each
variable will be declared to contain values of the preceding type.
The three dots signifies that you can have anything from zero to 256 arguments
to a function. The <i> statements </i> between the brackets are the function
body. Those statements will be executed whenever the function is called.
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
<example language=pike>
	int sqr(int x) { return x*x; }
</example>
This line defines a function called <tt>sqr</tt> to take one argument of the
type <tt>int</tt> and also returns an <tt>int</tt>. The code itself returns
the argument multiplied by itself. To call this function from somewhere in the code
you could simply put: <tt>sqr(17)</tt> and that would return the integer value
289.
<p>
As the example above shows, <tt>return</tt> is used to specify the
return value of a function. The value after <tt>return</tt> must be of the
type specified before the function name. If the function is specified to
return <tt>void</tt>, nothing at all should be written after <tt>return</tt>.
Note that when a return statement is executed, the function will finish
immediately. Any statements following the return will be ignored.
<p>
There are many more control structures, they will all be described in a
later chapter devoted only to control structures.
<p>
</section>

<section title="True and false">
Throughout this chapter the words <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> have been used
without any explanation to what they mean. Pike has a fairly simple way of
looking at this. The number 0 is false and everything else is true.
(Except when using operator overloading as I will explain in a later chapter.)
<p>
</section>

<section title="Data Types">
As you saw in our first examples we have to indicate the type of value returned by a function or contained in a variable. We used integers (<tt>int</tt>), strings (<tt>string</tt>), and arrays (with the * notation).
The others are <tt>mapping</tt>, <tt>mixed</tt>, <tt>void</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, <tt>multiset</tt>, <tt>function</tt>, <tt>object</tt> and <tt>program</tt>.
Neither <tt>mixed</tt> nor <tt>void</tt> are really types, <tt>void</tt> signifies that no value should be returned and <tt>mixed</tt> that the return value can be of any type, or that the variable can contain any type of value.
<tt>Function</tt>, <tt>object</tt> and <tt>program</tt> are all types related to object orientation. We will not discuss the last three in any great detail here,

<dl>
<dt>Int
<dd>The integer type stores a signed integer. It is 32 bit or 64 depending
on architecture.
<dt>Float
<dd>This variable type stores a floating point number.
<dt>Array
<dd>Arrays are basically a place to store a number of other values.
Arrays in Pike are allocated blocks of values.
They are dynamically allocated and do not need to be declared as in C.
The values in the array can be set when creating the array like this:
<example language=pike>
	arr=({1,2,3});
</example>
Or, if you have already created an array, you can change the values
in the array like this:
<example language=pike meta=arr,ind,data>
	arr [ ind ] = data;
</example>
This sets entry number <i>ind</i> in the array <i>arr</i> to <i>data</i>.
<i>ind</i> must be an integer.
The first index of an array is 0 (zero). A negative index will count from the end of the array rather than from the beginning, -1 being the last element.

To declare that a variable is an array we simply type <tt>array</tt> in
front of the variable name we want:
<example language=pike>
	array i;
</example>

We can also declare several array variables on the same line:
<example language=pike>
	array i, j;
</example>
If we want to specify that the variable should hold an array of strings,
we would write:
<example language=pike>
	array (string) i;
</example>

<dt>String
<dd>A string contains a sequence of characters, a text, i.e. a word, a sentence or a book.
Note that this is not simply the letters A to Z; special characters, null characters, newlines and so on can all be stored in a string.
Any 8-bit character is allowed.
String is a basic type in Pike, it is not an array of char like it is in C.
This means that you cannot assign new values to individual characters in a string.
Also, all strings are "shared", i.e. if the same string is used in several places, it will be stored in memory only once.
When writing a string in a program, you enclose it in double quotes. To write special characters you need to use the following syntax:
<table>
<tr><td><li>\n</td><td>newline</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>\r</td><td>carriage return</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>\t</td><td>tab</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>\b</td><td>backspace</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>\"</td><td>" (quotation character)</td></tr>
<tr><td><li>\\</td><td>\ (literal backslash)</td></tr>
</table>
<dt>Mapping
<dd>A mapping is basically an array that can be indexed on any type, not just integers. It can also be seen as a way of linking data (usually strings) together. It consists of a lot of index-data pairs which are linked together in such a way that map[index1] returns data1.
A mapping can be created in a way similar to arrays:
<example language=pike>
	mapping(string:string) map=(["five":"good", "ten":"excellent"]);
</example>
You can also set that data by writing map["five"]="good".
If you try to set an index in a mapping that isn't already present in the mapping it will be added as well.
<dt>Multiset
<dd>A multiset is basically a mapping without data values. When referring to an index in the multiset a 1 (one) will be returned if the index is present and 0 (zero) otherwise.
</dl>

</section>
</chapter>

<chapter title="A more elaborate example">
<!-- FIX ME: explain things AFTER showing the code? -->
To illustrate several of the fundamental points of Pike we will now
introduce an example program, that will be extended as we go.
We will build a database program that keeps track of a record
collection and the songs on the records. In the first version we
hard-code our "database" into the program. The database is a mapping
where the index is the record name and the data is an array of strings.
The strings are of course the song names. The default register consists
of one record.
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike

	mapping (string:array(string)) records =
	([
	  "Star Wars Trilogy" : ({
	    "Fox Fanfare",
	    "Main Title",
	    "Princess Leia's Theme",
	    "Here They Come",
	    "The Asteroid Field",
	    "Yoda's Theme",
	    "The Imperial March",
	    "Parade of the Ewoks",
	    "Luke and Leia",
	    "Fight with Tie Fighters",
	    "Jabba the Hut",
	    "Darth Vader's Death",
	    "The Forest Battle",
	    "Finale"
	  })
	]);
</example>
We want to be able to get a simple list of the records in our database. The function <tt>list_records</tt> just goes through the mapping <tt>records</tt> and puts the indices, i.e. the record names, in an array of strings, record_names. By using the builtin function <tt>sort</tt> we put the record names into the array in alphabetical order which might be a nice touch.
For the printout we just print a header, "Records:", followed by a newline. Then we use the loop control structure <tt>for</tt> to traverse the array and print every item in it, including the number of the record, by counting up from zero to the last item of the array. The builtin function <tt>sizeof</tt> gives the number of items in an array. The printout is formatted through the use of <tt>sprintf</tt> which works more or less like the C function of the same name.
<example language=pike>
	void list_records()
	{
	  int i;
	  array (string) record_names=sort(indices(records));

	  write("Records:\n");
	  for(i=0;i&lt;sizeof(record_names);i++)
	    write(sprintf("%3d: %s\n", i+1, record_names[i]));
	}
</example>
If the command line contained a number our program will find the record of that number and print its name along with the songs of this record. First we create the same array of record names as in the previous function, then we find the name of the record whose number (<tt>num</tt>) we gave as an argument to this function. Next we put the songs of this record in the array <tt>songs</tt> and print the record name followed by the songs, each song on a separate line.
<example language=pike>
	void show_record(int num)
	{
	  int i;
	  array (string) record_names =	sort(indices (records));
	  string name=record_names[num-1];
	  array (string) songs=records[name];
  
	  write(sprintf("Record %d, %s\n",num,name));
	  for(i=0;i&lt;sizeof(songs);i++)
	    write(sprintf("%3d: %s\n", i+1, songs[i]));
	}
</example>
The main function doesn't do much; it checks whether there was anything on the command line after the invocation.
If this is not the case it calls the list_records function, otherwise it sends the given argument to the show_record function.
When the called function is done the program just quits.
<example language=pike>
	int main(int argc, array (string) argv)
	{
	  if(argc &lt;= 1)
	  {
	    list_records();
	  } else {
	    show_record((int) argv[1]);
	  }
	}
</example>

<section title="Taking care of input">
Now, it would be better and more general if we could enter more records into our database. Let's add such a function and modify the <tt>main()</tt> function to accept "commands".
<p>

<section title="add_record()">

Using the builtin function <tt>readline()</tt> we wait for input which will be put into the variable <tt>record_name</tt>. The argument to <tt>readline()</tt> is printed as a prompt in front of the user's input. Readline takes everything up to a newline character.
Now we use the control structure <tt>while</tt> to check whether we should continue inputting songs.
The <tt>while(1)</tt> means "loop forever", because 1 is always <b>true</b>.
This program does not in fact loop forever, because it uses <tt>return</tt>
to exit the function from within the loop when you type a period.
When something has been read into the variable song it is checked.
If it is a "." we return a null value that will be used in the while statement to indicate that it is not ok to continue asking for song names.
If it is not a dot, the string will be added to the array of songs for this record, unless it's an empty string.
Note the <tt>+=</tt> operator. It is the same as saying
<tt>records[record_name]=records[record_name]+({song})</tt>.
<example language=pike>
	void add_record()
	{
	  string record_name=readline("Record name: ");
	  records[record_name]=({});
	  write("Input song names, one per line. End with '.' on its own line.\n");
	  while(1)
	  {
	    string song;
	    song=readline(sprintf("Song %2d: ",
	                          sizeof(records[record_name])+1));
	    if(song==".")
	       return;
	    if (strlen(song))
	      records[record_name]+=({song});
	  }
	}
</example>

</section>

<section title="main()">
The main function now does not care about any command line arguments.
Instead we use <tt>readline()</tt> to prompt the user for instructions
and arguments. The available instructions are "add", "list" and "quit".
What you enter into the variables <tt>cmd</tt> and <tt>args</tt> is checked in the
<tt>switch()</tt> block. If you enter something that is not covered
in any of the case statements the program just silently ignores it and
asks for a new command.
In a <tt>switch()</tt> the argument (in this case <tt>cmd</tt>) is checked in the <tt>case</tt> statements. The first case where the expression equals <tt>cmd</tt> then executes the statement after the colon. If no expression is equal, we just fall through without any action.

The only command that takes an argument is "list" which works as in the first version of the program.
If "list" receives an argument, that record is shown along with all the songs
on it. If there is no argument it shows a list of the records in the database.

 When the program returns from either of the listing functions, the <tt>break</tt> instruction tells the program to jump out of the <tt>switch()</tt> block.
"add" of course turns control over to the function described above.
If the command given is "quit" the <tt>exit(0)</tt> statement stops the execution of the program and returns 0 (zero) to the operating system, telling it that everything was ok.
<example language=pike>
	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  string cmd;
	  while(cmd=readline("Command: "))
	  {
	    string args;
	    sscanf(cmd,"%s %s",cmd,args);

	    switch(cmd)
	    {
	    case "list":
	      if((int)args)
	      {
	        show_record((int)args);
	      } else {
	        list_records();
	      }
	      break;

	    case "quit":
	      exit(0);

	    case "add":
	      add_record();
	      break;
	    }
	  }
	}
</example>

<section title="Communicating with files">
Now if we want to save the database and also be able to retrieve previously stored data we have to communicate with the environment, i.e. with files on disk.
Now we will introduce you to programming with objects.
To open a file for reading or writing we will use one of the programs which is builtin in Pike called <tt>Stdio.File</tt>.
To Pike, a program is a data type which contains code, functions and variables.
A program can be <i>cloned</i> which means that Pike creates a data area
 in memory for the program, places a reference to the program in the data area, and initializes it to act on the data in question. The methods (i.e. functions in the object) and variables in the object Stdio.File enable us to perform actions on the associated data file.
The methods we need to use are open, read, write and close. See <ref to=io>
for more details. <!-- Does this link work? -->
<p>

<section title="save()">
First we clone a <tt>Stdio.File</tt> program to the object <tt>o</tt>.
Then we use it to open the file whose<!-- FIX ME: which instead of whose? --> name is given in the string file_name for writing.
We use the fact that if there is an error during opening, open() will return a false value which we can detect and act upon by exiting.
The arrow operator (-&gt;) is what you use to access methods and variables in an object.
If there is no error we use yet another control structure, <tt>foreach</tt>, to go through the mapping <tt>records</tt> one record at a time.
We precede record names with the string "Record: " and song names with "Song: ".
We also put every entry, be it song or record, on its own line by adding a newline to everything we write to the file.<br>
Finally, remember to close the file.
<example language=pike>
	void save(string file_name)
	{
	  string name, song;
	  Stdio.File o=Stdio.File();

	  if(!o-&gt;open(file_name,"wct"))
	  {
	    write("Failed to open file.\n");
	    return;
	  }

	  foreach(indices(records),name)
	  {
	     o-&gt;write("Record: "+name+"\n");
	     foreach(records[name],song)
	       o-&gt;write("Song: "+song+"\n");
	  }

	  o-&gt;close();
	}
</example>

</section>

<section title="load()">

The <tt>load</tt> function begins much the same, except we open the file named <tt>file</tt> for reading instead.
When receiving data from the file we put it in the string <tt>file_contents</tt>.
The absence of arguments to the method o-&gt;read means that the reading should not end until the end of the file.
After having closed the file we initialize our database, i.e. the mapping records. Then we have to put <tt>file_contents</tt> into the mapping and we do this by splitting the string on newlines (cf. the split operator in Perl) using the division operator. Yes, that's right: by dividing one string with another we can obtain an array consisting of parts from the first. And by using a <tt>foreach</tt> statement we can take the string <tt>file_contents</tt> apart piece by piece, putting each piece back in its proper place in the mapping records.
<example language=pike>
	void load(string file_name)
	{
	  string name="ERROR";
	  string file_contents,line;

	  Stdio.File o=Stdio.File();
	  if(!o-&gt;open(file_name,"r"))
	  {
	    write("Failed to open file.\n");
	    return;
	  }

	  file_contents=o-&gt;read();
	  o-&gt;close();

	  records=([]);

	  foreach(file_contents/"\n",line)
	  {
	    string cmd, arg;
	    if(sscanf(line,"%s: %s",cmd,arg))
	    {
	      switch(lower_case(cmd))
	      {
	      case "record":
	        name=arg;
	        records[name]=({});
	        break;

	       case "song":
	         records[name]+=({arg});
	         break;
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}
</example>
</section>

<section title="main() revisited">

<tt>main()</tt> remains almost unchanged, except for the addition of two case statements with which we now can call the load and save functions. Note that you must provide a filename to load and save, respectively, otherwise they will return an error which will crash the program.
<example language=pike>
	case "save":
	  save(args);
	  break;

	case "load":
	  load(args);
	  break;
</example>
<p>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Completing the program">
Now let's add the last functions we need to make this program useful: the ability to delete entries and search for songs.
<p>

<section title="delete()">
If you sell one of your records it might be nice to able to delete that entry from the database. The delete function is quite simple.
First we set up an array of record names (cf. the <tt>list_records</tt> function).
Then we find the name of the record of the number <tt>num</tt> and use the builtin function <tt>m_delete()</tt> to remove that entry from <tt>records</tt>.
<example language=pike>
	void delete_record(int num)
	{
	  array(string) record_names=sort(indices(records));
	  string name=record_names[num-1];

	  m_delete(records,name);
	}
</example>
</section>

<section title="search()">
Searching for songs is quite easy too. To count the number of hits we declare the variable <tt>hits</tt>. Note that it's not necessary to initialize variables, that is done automatically when the variable is declared if you do not do it explicitly. To be able to use the builtin function <tt>search()</tt>, which searches for the presence of a given string inside another, we put the search string in lowercase and compare it with the lowercase version of every song. The use of <tt>search()</tt> enables us to search for partial song titles as well.
When a match is found it is immediately written to standard output with the record name followed by the name of the song where the search string was found and a newline.
If there were no hits at all, the function prints out a message saying just that.
<example language=pike>
	void find_song(string title)
	{
	  string name, song;
	  int hits;

	  title=lower_case(title);

	  foreach(indices(records),name)
	  {
	    foreach(records[name],song)
	    {
	      if(search(lower_case(song), title) != -1)
	      {
	        write(name+"; "+song+"\n");
	        hits++;
	      }
	    }
	  }

	  if(!hits) write("Not found.\n");
	}
</example>
</section>

<section title="main() again">
Once again <tt>main()</tt> is left unchanged, except for yet another two case statements used to call the <tt>search()</tt> and <tt>delete</tt> functions, respectively. Note that you must provide an argument to delete or it will not work properly.
<example language=pike>
	case "delete":
	  delete_record((int)args);
	  break;

	case "search":
	  find_song(args);
	  break;
</example>

<section title="Then what?">
Well that's it! The example is now a complete working example of a Pike program. But of course there are plenty of details that we haven't attended to. Error checking is for example extremely sparse in our program. This is left for you
to do as you continue to read this book. The complete listing of this example can be found in <ref to=register_program>. Read it, study it and enjoy!

<chapter title="Control Structures">

In this chapter all the control structures in Pike will be explained. As
mentioned earlier, control structures are used to control the flow of the
program execution. Note that functions that make the program pause and
simple function calls are not qualified as control structures.

<section title="Conditions">
Pike only has two major condition control structures. We have already seen
examples of both of them in Chapter two. But for completeness they will be
described again in this chapter.
<p>

<section title="if">

The simplest one is called the <b>if statement</b>. It can be written anywhere
where a statement is expected and it looks like this:
<example language=pre meta=expression,statement1,statement2>
	if( expression )
	  statement1;
	else
	  statement2;
</example>
Please note that there is no semicolon after the parenthesis or after the
<tt>else</tt>. Step by step, <tt>if</tt> does the following:
<ol>
<li>First it evaluates <i>expression</i>.<br>
<li>If the result was <b>false</b> go to point 5.
<li>Execute <i>statement1</i>.
<li>Jump to point 6.
<li>Execute <i>statement2</i>.
<li>Done.
</ol>

This is actually more or less how the interpreter executes the if statement.
In short, <i>statement1</i> is executed if <i>expression</i> is <b>true</b>
otherwise <i>statement2</i> is executed. If you are interested in
having something executed if the expression is false you can drop the
whole else part like this:
<example language=pike meta=expression,statement1>
	if( expression )
	  statement1;
</example>
If on the other hand you are not interested in evaluating something if the
expression is <b>false</b> you should use the <b>not</b> operator to negate
the true/false value of the expression. See chapter 5 for more information
about the <b>not</b> operator. It would look like this:
<example language=pike meta=expression,statement2>
	if( ! expression )
	  statement2 ;
</example>
Any of the statements here and in the rest of this chapter can
also be a <b>block</b> of statements. A block is a list of statements,
separated by semicolons and enclosed by brackets. Note that you should
never put a semicolon after a block of statements. The example above
would look like this;
<example language=pike meta=expression,statement>
	if ( ! expression )
	{
	  statement;
	  statement;
	  statement;
	}
</example>
</section>

<section title="switch">

A more sophisticated condition control structure is the <b>switch
statement</b>.
A switch lets you select one of many choices depending on the value of an
expression and it can look something like this:
<example language=pike meta=expression,constant1,constant2,constant3,constant4,expressions1,expressions2,expressions3,expressions5>
	switch ( expression )
	{
	  case constant1:
	    statement1;
	    break;

 	  case constant2:
	    statement2;
	    break;

 	  case constant3 .. constant4:
	    statement3;
	    break;

	  default:
	    statement5;
	}
</example>
As you can see, a switch statement is a bit more complicated than an
if statement. It is still fairly simple however. It starts by evaluating
the expression it then searches all the <tt>case</tt> statements in the
following block. If one is found to be equal to the value returned by
the expression, Pike will continue executing the code directly following
that <tt>case</tt> statement. When a <tt>break</tt> is encountered Pike
will skip the rest of the code in the switch block and continue executing
after the block. Note that it is not strictly necessary to have a break
before the next case statement. If there is no break before the next case
statement Pike will simply continue executing and execute the code after
that case statement as well.
<p>
One of the case statements in the above example differs in that it is
a <b>range</b>. In this case, any value between <i>constant3</i> and
<i>constant4</i> will cause Pike to jump to <i>statement3</i>. Note
that the ranges are inclusive, so the values <i>constant3</i> and
<i>constant4</i> are also valid.

</section>
</section>

<section title="Loops">

Loops are used to execute a piece of code more than once. Since this can
be done in quite a few different ways there are four different loop
control structures. They may all seem very similar, but using the right
one at the right time makes the code a lot shorter and simpler.

<section title="while">
<tt>While</tt> is the simplest of the loop control structures. It looks
just like an <tt>if</tt> statement without the else part:
<example language=pike meta=expression,statement>
	while ( expression )
	  statement;
</example>
The difference in how it works isn't that big either, the statement is
executed if the expression is true. Then the expression is evaluated
again, and if it is true the statement is executed again. Then it
evaluates the expression again and so forth... Here is an example of
how it could be used:
<example language=pike>
	int e=1;
	while(e&lt;5)
	{
	  show_record(e);
	  e=e+1;
	}
</example>
This would call show_record with the values 1, 2, 3 and 4.
</section>

<section title="for">

<tt>For</tt> is simply an extension of <tt>while</tt>. It provides an
even shorter and more compact way of writing loops. The syntax looks
like this:
<example language=pike meta=initializer_statement,expression,increment_expression,statement>
	for ( initializer_statement ; expression ; incrementor_expression )
	  statement ;
</example>
For does the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Executes the the <i>initializer_statement</i>. The initializer statement
     is executed only once and is most commonly used to initialize the loop
      variable.
<li> Evaluates <i>expression</i>
<li> If the result was false it exits the loop and continues with the
     program after the loop.
<li> Executes <i>statement</i>.
<li> Executes the <i>increment_expression</i>.
<li> Starts over from 2.
</ol>
This means that the example in the while section can be written like this:
<example language=pike>
	for(int e=1; e&lt;5; e=e+1)
	  show_record(e);
</example>
</section>

<section title="do-while">

Sometimes it is unpractical that the expression is always evaluated before
the first time the loop is executed. Quite often you want to execute
something, and then do it over and over until some condition is satisfied.
This is exactly when you should use the do-while statement.
<example language=pike meta=statement,expression>
	do
	  statement;
	while ( expression );
</example>
As usual, the <i>statement</i> can also be a block of statements, and then
you do not need a semicolon after it. To clarify, this statement executes
<i>statement</i> first, and then evaluates the <i>expression</i>. If the
expression is <b>true</b> it executes the loop again. For instance, if you
want to make a program that lets your modem dial your Internet provider,
it could look something like this:
<!-- Can someone come up with a better example? -->
<example language=pike>
	do {
	  modem-&gt;write("ATDT441-9109\n"); // Dial 441-9109
        } while(modem-&gt;gets()[..6]] != "CONNECT");
</example>
This example assumes you have written something that can communicate with
the modem by using the functions <tt>write</tt> and <tt>gets</tt>.

</section>

<section title="foreach">

<tt>Foreach</tt> is unique in that it does not have an explicit test expression
evaluated for each iteration in the loop. Instead, <tt>foreach</tt> executes
the statement once for each element in an array. <tt>Foreach</tt> looks like
this:
<example language=pike meta=array_expression,variable,statement>
	foreach ( array_expression, variable )
	  statement ;
</example>
We have already seen an example of <tt>foreach</tt> in the <tt>find_song</tt>
function in chapter 2. What foreach does is:
<ol>
<li> It evaluates the <i>array_expression</i> which must return an array.
<li> If the array is empty, exit the loop.
<li> It then assigns the first element from the array to the <i>variable</i>.
<li> Then it executes the <i>statement</i>.
<li> If there are more elements in the array, the next one is assigned to
     the <i>variable</i>, otherwise exit the loop.
<li> Go to point 4.
</ol>
<tt>Foreach</tt> is not really necessary, but it is faster and clearer than
doing the same thing with a <tt>for</tt> loop, as shown here:
<example language=pike meta=array_expression,variable,statement>
	array tmp1= array_expression;
	for ( tmp2 = 0; tmp2 &lt; sizeof(tmp1); tmp2++ )
	{
	  variable = tmp1 [ tmp2 ];
	  statement;
	}
</example>
<p>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Breaking out of loops">
The loop control structures above are enough to solve any problem, but
they are not enough to provide an easy solution to all problems. One thing
that is still missing is the ability to exit a loop in the middle of it.
There are three ways to do this:

<section title="break">
<tt>Break</tt><!-- FIX ME: liten bokstav? --> exits a loop or switch statement immediately and continues
executing after the loop. <tt>Break</tt> can not be used outside of a loop or
switch. It is quite useful in conjunction with <tt>while(1)</tt> to
construct command parsing loops for instance:
<example language=pike>
	while(1)
	{
	  string command=readline("&gt; ");
	  if(command=="quit") break;
	  do_command(command);
	}
</example>
</section>

<section title="continue">
<tt>Continue</tt> does almost the same thing as <tt>break</tt>, except instead of
breaking out of the loop it only breaks out of the loop body. It then continues
to execute the next iteration in the loop. For a <tt>while</tt> loop, this
means it jumps up to the top again. For a <tt>for</tt> loop, it jumps to the
incrementor expression. For a <tt>do-while</tt> loop it jumps down to the
expression at the end. To continue our example above, <tt>continue</tt> can be used
like this:
<example language=pike>
	while(1)
	{
	  string command=readline("&gt; ");
	  if(strlen(command) == 0) continue;
	  if(command=="quit") break;
	  do_command(command);
	}
</example>
This way, <tt>do_command</tt> will never be called with an empty string as
argument.
</section>

<section title="return">

<tt>Return</tt> doesn't just exit the loop, it exits the whole function. We have seen
several examples how to use it chapter 2. None of the functions in chapter
two returned anything in particular however. To do that you just put the return
value right after <tt>return</tt>. Of course the type of the return value
must match the type in the function declaration. If your function declaration
is <tt>int main()</tt> the value after <tt>return</tt> must be an <b>int</b>.
For instance, if we wanted to make a program that always returns an error
code to the system, just like the UNIX command <tt>false</tt> this is how
it would be done:
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike

	int main()
	{
	  return 1;
	}
</example>
This would return the error code <tt>1</tt> to the system when the program
is run.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Data types">

In this chapter we will discuss all the different ways to store data
in Pike in detail. We have seen examples of many of these, but we haven't
really gone into how they work. In this chapter we will also see which
operators and functions work with the different types.
There are two categories of data types in Pike: <b>basic types</b>, and
<b>pointer types</b>. The difference is that basic types are copied when
assigned to a variable. With pointer types, merely the pointer is copied,
that way you get two variables pointing to the same thing.
<p>

<section title="Basic types">
The basic types are <tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt> and <tt>string</tt>.
For you who are accustomed to C or C++, it may seem odd that a string
is a basic type as opposed to an array of char, but it is surprisingly
easy to get used to.

<section title="int">
<tt>Int</tt> is short for integer, or integer number. They are normally
32 bit integers, which means that they are in the range -2147483648 to
2147483647. Note that on some machines an <tt>int</tt> might be larger
than 32 bits. Since they are integers, no decimals are allowed. An integer
constant can be written in several ways:
<pre>
	78	// decimal number
	0116	// octal number
	0x4e	// hexadecimal number
	'N'	// Ascii character
</pre>
All of the above represent the number 78. Octal notation means that
each digit is worth 8 times as much as the one after. Hexadecimal notation
means that each digit is worth 16 times as much as the one after.
Hexadecimal notation uses the letters a, b, c, d, e and f to represent the
numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. The ASCII notation gives the ASCII
value of the character between the single quotes. In this case the character
is <tt>N</tt> which just happens to be 78 in ASCII.
<p>
Integers are coded in 2-complement and overflows are silently ignored
by Pike. This means that if your integers are 32-bit and you add 1 to
the number 2147483647 you get the number -2147483648. This works exactly
as in C or C++.
<p>
All the arithmetic, bitwise and comparison operators can be used on integers.
Also note these functions:
<dl>
<dt><tt>int intp(mixed <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns 1 if <i>x</i> is an int, 0 otherwise.
<dt><tt>int random(int <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns a random number greater or equal to zero and smaller than <i>x</i>.
<dt><tt>int reverse(int <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function reverses the order of the bits in <i>x</i> and returns the new number. It is not very useful.
<dt><tt>int sqrt(int <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This computes the square root of <i>x</i>. The value is always rounded down.
</dl>
</section>

<section title="float">
<!-- FIX ME: Du borde skriva något om att float och int inte är kompatibla och ingen 
implicit casting sker som i C++ -->
Although most programs only use integers, they are unpractical when doing
trigonometric calculations, transformations or anything else where you
need decimals. For this purpose you use <tt>float</tt>. Floats are normally
32 bit floating point numbers, which means that they can represent very large
and very small numbers, but only with 9 accurate digits. To write a floating
point constant, you just put in the decimals or write it in the exponential
form:
<example language=pike>
	3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510 // Pi
	1.0e9  // A billion
	1.0e-9 // A billionth
</example>
Of course you do not need this many decimals, but it doesn't hurt either.
Usually digits after the ninth digit are ignored, but on some architectures
<tt>float</tt> might have higher accuracy than that. In the exponential form,
<tt>e</tt> means "times 10 to the power of", so <tt>1.0e9</tt> is equal to
"1.0 times 10 to the power of 9".
<p>
All the arithmetic and comparison operators can be used on floats.
Also, these functions operates on floats:
<dl>
<dt>trigonometric functions
<dd> The trigonometric functions are: <tt>sin</tt>, <tt>asin</tt>,
     <tt>cos</tt>, <tt>acos</tt>, <tt>tan</tt> and <tt>atan</tt>.
     If you do not know what these functions do you probably don't
     need them. Asin, acos and atan are of course short for
     arc sine, arc cosine and arc tangent. On a calculator they
     are often known as inverse sine, inverse cosine and
     inverse tangent.

<dt><tt>float log(float <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function computes the natural logarithm of <i>x</i>,

<dt><tt>float exp(float <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function computes <b>e</b> raised to the power of <i>x</i>.

<dt><tt>float pow(float <i>x</i>, float <i>y</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function computes <i>x</i> raised to the power of <i>y</i>.

<dt><tt>float sqrt(float <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This computes the square root of <i>x</i>.

<dt><tt>float floor(float <i>x</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function computes the largest integer value less than or equal to <i>x</i>. Note that the value is returned as a <tt>float</tt>, not an <tt>int</tt>.

<section title="string">
A <tt>string</tt> can be seen as an array of values from 0 to 2³²-1.
Usually a string contains text such as a word, a sentence, a page or
even a whole book. But it can also contain parts of a binary file,
compressed data or other binary data. Strings in Pike are <b>shared</b>,
which means that identical strings share the same memory space. This
reduces memory usage very much for most applications and also speeds
up string comparisons. We have already seen how to write a constant
string:
<pre>
	"hello world" // hello world
	"he" "llo"    // hello
	"\116"        // N (116 is the octal ASCII value for N)
	"\t"          // A tab character
	"\n"          // A newline character
	"\r"          // A carriage return character
	"\b"          // A backspace character
	"\0"          // A null character
	"\""          // A double quote character
	"\\"          // A singe backslash
	"\x4e"        // N (4e is the hexadecimal ASCII value for N)
	"\d78"        // N (78 is the decimal ACII value for N)
	"hello world\116\t\n\r\b\0\"\\" // All of the above
	"\xff"        // the character 255
	"\xffff"      // the character 65536
	"\xffffff"    // the character 16777215
	"\116""3"     // 'N' followed by a '3'
</pre>
As you can see, any sequence of characters within double quotes is a string.
The backslash character is used to escape characters that are not allowed or
impossible to type. As you can see, <tt>\t</tt> is the sequence to produce
a tab character, <tt>\\</tt> is used when you want one backslash and
<tt>\"</tt> is used when you want a double quote (<tt>"</tt>) to be a part
of the string instead of ending it.
Also, <tt>\<i>XXX</i></tt> where <i>XXX</i> is an
octal number from 0 to 37777777777 or <tt>\x<i>XX</i></tt> where <i>XX</i>
is 0 to ffffffff lets you write any character you want in the
string, even null characters. From version 0.6.105, you may also use
<tt>\d<i>XXX</i></tt> where <i>XXX</i> is 0 to 2³²-1. If you write two constant
strings after each other, they will be concatenated into one string.
<p>
You might be surprised to see that individual characters can have values
up to 2³²-1 and wonder how much memory that use. Do not worry, Pike
automatically decides the proper amount of memory for a string, so all
strings with character values in the range 0-255 will be stored with
one byte per character. You should also beware that not all functions
can handle strings which are not stored as one byte per character, so
there are some limits to when this feature can be used.
<p>
Although strings are a form of arrays, they are immutable. This means that
there is no way to change an individual character within a string without
creating a new string. This may seem strange, but keep in mind that strings
are shared, so if you would change a character in the string <tt>"foo"</tt>,
you would change *all* <tt>"foo"</tt> everywhere in the program.
<p>
However, the Pike compiler will allow you to to write code like you could
change characters within strings, the following code is valid and works:
<example language=pike>
	string s="hello torld";
	s[6]='w';
</example>
However, you should be aware that this does in fact create a new string and
it may need to copy the string <i>s</i> to do so. This means that the above
operation can be quite slow for large strings. You have been warned.
Most of the time, you can use <tt>replace</tt>, <tt>sscanf</tt>, <tt>`/</tt>
or some other high-level string operation to avoid having to use the above
construction too much.
<p>
All the comparison operators plus the operators listed here can be used on strings:
<dl>
<dt> Summation
<dd> Adding strings together will simply concatenate them.
     <tt>"foo"+"bar"</tt> becomes <tt>"foobar"</tt>.
<dt> Subtraction
<dd> Subtracting one string from another will remove all occurrences
     of the second string from the first one. So 
     <tt>"foobarfoogazonk" - "foo"</tt> results in <tt>"bargazonk"</tt>.
<dt> Indexing
<dd> Indexing will let you get the ASCII value of any character in a string.
     The first index is zero.
<dt> Range
<dd> The range operator will let you copy any part of the string into a
     new string. Example: <tt>"foobar"[2..4]</tt> will return <tt>"oba"</tt>.
<dt> Division
<dd> Division will let you divide a string at every occurrence of a word or
     character. For instance if you do <tt>"foobargazonk" / "o"</tt> the
     result would be <tt>({"f","","bargaz","nk"})</tt>. It is also possible
     to divide the string into strings of length N by dividing the string
     by N. If N is converted to a float before dividing, the reminder of
     the division will be included in the result.
<dt> Multiplication
<dd> The inverse of the division operator can be accomplished by multiplying
     an array with a string. So if you evaluate
     <tt>({"f","","bargaz","nk"}) * "o"</tt> the result would be
     <tt>"foobargazonk"</tt>.
<dt> Modulo
<dd> To complement the division operator, you can do <tt>string</tt> % <tt>int</tt>.
     This operator will simply return the part of the string that was not 
     included in the array returned by <tt>string</tt> / <tt>int</tt>
</dl>
<p>
Also, these functions operates on strings:
<dl>
<dt><tt>string String.capitalize(string <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>Returns <i>s</i> with the first character converted to upper case.

<dt><tt>string lower_case(string <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>Returns <i>s</i> with all the upper case characters converted to lower case.

<dt><tt>string replace(string <i>s</i>, string <i>from</i>, string <i>to</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function replaces all occurrences of the string <i>from</i> in <i>s</i> with <i>to</i> and returns the new string.

<dt><tt>string reverse(string <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns a copy of <i>s</i> with the last byte from <i>s</i>
    first, the second last in second place and so on.

<dt><tt>int search(string <i>haystack</i>, string <i>needle</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function finds the first occurrence of <i>needle</i> in <i>haystack</i> and returns where it found it.

<dt><tt>string sizeof(string <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>Same as <tt>strlen(<i>s</i>)</tt>, returns the length of the string.

<dt><tt>int stringp(mixed <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns 1 if <i>s</i> is a string, 0 otherwise.

<dt><tt>string strlen(string <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>Returns the length of the string <i>s</i>.

<dt><tt>string upper_case(string <i>s</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns <i>s</i> with all lower case characters converted
    to upper case.
</dl>

<section title="Pointer types">
The basic types are, as the name implies, very basic. They are the foundation,
most of the pointer types are merely interesting ways to store the basic
types. The pointer types are <tt>array</tt>, <tt>mapping</tt>,
<tt>multiset</tt>, <tt>program</tt>, <tt>object</tt> and <tt>function</tt>.
They are all <b>pointers</b> which means that they point to something
in memory. This "something" is freed when there are no more pointers to it.
Assigning a variable with a value of a pointer type will not copy this
"something" instead it will only generate a new reference to it. Special care
sometimes has to be taken when giving one of these types as arguments to
a function; the function can in fact modify the "something". If this effect
is not wanted you have to explicitly copy the value. More about this will
be explained later in this chapter.

<section title="array">
Arrays are the simplest of the pointer types. An array is merely a block of
memory with a fixed size containing a number of slots which can hold any
type of value. These slots are called <b>elements</b> and are accessible
through the index operator. To write a constant array you enclose the
values you want in the array with <tt>({ })</tt> like this:
<pre>
	({ })      // Empty array
	({ 1 })    // Array containing one element of type int
	({ "" })   // Array containing a string
	({ "", 1, 3.0 }) // Array of three elements, each of different type
</pre>
As you can see, each element in the array can contain any type of value.
Indexing and ranges on arrays works just like on strings, except with
arrays you can change values inside the array with the index operator.
However, there is no way to change the size of the array, so if you want
to append values to the end you still have to add it to another array
which creates a new array. Figure 4.1 shows how the schematics of an array.
As you can see, it is a very simple memory structure.
<p>
<center>
<image xfig=array><br>
fig 4.1
</center>
<p>
Operators and functions usable with arrays:
<dl>
<dt> indexing ( <tt><i>arr</i> [ <i>c</i> ]</tt> )
<dd> Indexing an array retrieves or sets a given element in the array.
     The index <i>c</i> has to be an integer. To set an index, simply put
     the whole thing on the left side of an assignment, like this:
     <tt><i>arr</i> [ <i>c</i> ] = <i>new_value</i></tt>

<dt> range ( <tt><i>arr</i> [ <i>from</i> .. <i>to</i> ]</tt> )
<dd> The range copies the elements <i>from</i>, <i>from</i>+1, , <i>from</i>+2 ... <i>to</i> into a new array. The new array will have the size <i>to</i>-<i>from</i>+1.

<dt> comparing (<tt><i>a</i> == <i>b</i></tt> and <tt><i>a</i> != <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> The equal operator returns 1 if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the <b>same</b> arrays. It is not enough that they have the same size and same data. They must
 be the same array. For example: <tt>({1}) == ({1})</tt> would return 0, while
<tt>array(int) a=({1}); return a==a;</tt> would return 1. Note that you cannot
use the operators <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;=</tt> on arrays.

<dt> Summation (<tt><i>a</i> + <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> As with strings, summation concatenates arrays. <tt>({1})+({2})</tt> returns <tt>({1,2})</tt>.

<dt> Subtractions (<tt><i>a</i> - <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> Subtracting one array from another returns a copy of
    <i>a</i> with all the elements that are also present in <i>b</i> removed.
    So <tt>({1,3,8,3,2}) - ({3,1})</tt> returns <tt>({8,2})</tt>.

<dt> Intersection (<tt><i>a</i> &amp; <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> Intersection returns an array with all values that are present in both
     <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The order of the elements will be the same as
     the the order of the elements in <i>a</i>. Example:
     <tt>({1,3,7,9,11,12}) &amp; ({4,11,8,9,1})</tt> will return:
     <tt>({1,9,11})</tt>.

<dt> Union (<tt><i>a</i> | <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> Union works almost as summation, but it only concatenates elements not
     already present in <i>a</i>. So, <tt>({1,2,3}) | ({1,3,5})</tt> will
     return <tt>({1,2,3,5})</tt>.

<dt> Xor (<tt><i>a</i> ^ <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd>  This is also called symmetric difference. It returns an array with all
     elements present in <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> but the element must NOT
     be present in both. Example: <tt>({1,3,5,6}) ^ ({4,5,6,7})</tt> will
     return <tt>({1,3,4,7})</tt>.

<dt> Division (<tt><i>a</i> / <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> This will split the array <i>a</i> into an array of arrays. If <i>b</i> is
     another array, <i>a</i> will be split at each occurance of that array.
     If <i>b</i> is an integer or float, <i>a</i> will be split between
     every <i>b</i>th element. Examples: <tt>({1,2,3,4,5})/({2,3})</tt> will
     return <tt>({ ({1}), ({4,5}) })</tt> and <tt>({1,2,3,4})/2</tt> will
     return <tt>({ ({1,2}), ({3,4}) })</tt>.

<dt> Modulo (<tt><i>a</i> % <i>b</i></tt>)
<dd> This operation is valid only if <i>b</i> is an integer. It will return
     the part of the array that was not included by dividing <i>a</i> by
     <i>b</i>.

<dt><tt>array aggregate(mixed ... <i>elems</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function does the same as the <tt>({ })</tt> operator; it creates an
     array from all arguments given to it. In fact, writing <tt>({1,2,3})</tt>
     is the same as writing <tt>aggregate(1,2,3)</tt>.

<dt><tt>array allocate(int <i>size</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function allocates a new array of size <tt>size</tt>. All the elements
    in the new array will be zeroes.

<dt><tt>int arrayp(mixed <i>a</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns 1 if <i>a</i> is an array, 0 otherwise.

<dt><tt>array column(array(mixed) <i>a</i>, mixed <i>ind</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function goes through the array <i>a</i> and indexes every element
    in it on <i>ind</i> and builds an array of the results. So if you have
    an array <i>a</i> in which each element is a also an array. This function
    will take a cross section, by picking out element <i>ind</i> from each
    of the arrays in <i>a</i>. Example:
    <tt>column( ({ ({1,2,3}), ({4,5,6}), ({7,8,9}) }), 2)</tt> will return
    <tt>({3,6,9})</tt>.

<dt><tt>int equal(mixed <i>a</i>, mixed <i>b</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns 1 if if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> look the same. They
     do not have to be pointers to the same array, as long as they are the same
     size and contain equal data.

<dt><tt>array Array.filter(array <i>a</i>, mixed <i>func</i>, mixed ... <i>args</i>)</tt>
<dd> <tt>filter</tt> returns every element in <i>a</i> for which <i>func</i> returns <b>true</b> when called with that element as first argument, and <i>args</i> for the second, third, etc. arguments.

<dt><tt>array Array.map(array <i>a</i>, mixed <i>func</i>, mixed ... <i>args</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function works similar to <tt>Array.filter</tt> but returns the results
     of the function <i>func</i> instead of returning the elements from <i>a</i> for which <i>func</i> returns <b>true</b>.

<dt><tt>array replace(array <i>a</i>, mixed <i>from</i>, mixed <i>to</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function will create a copy of <i>a</i> with all elements equal to
    <i>from</i> replaced by <i>to</i>.

<dt><tt>array reverse(array <i>a</i>)</tt>
<dd><tt>Reverse</tt> will create a copy of <i>a</i> with the last element first, the last but one second, and so on.

<dt><tt>array rows(array <i>a</i>, array <i>indexes</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function is similar to <tt>column</tt>. It indexes <i>a</i> with
 each element from <i>indexes</i> and returns the results in an array.
For example: <tt>rows( ({"a","b","c"}), ({ 2,1,2,0}) ) </tt> will return
<tt>({"c","b","c","a"})</tt>.

<dt><tt>int search(array <i>haystack</i>, mixed <i>needle</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns the index of the first occurrence of an element
    equal (tested with <tt>==</tt>) to <i>needle</i> in the array
    <i>haystack</i>. 

<dt><tt>int sizeof(mixed <i>arr</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns the number of elements in the array <i>arr</i>.

<dt><tt>array sort(array <i>arr</i>, array ... <i>rest</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function sorts <i>arr</i> in smaller-to-larger order. Numbers, floats
    and strings can be sorted. If there are any additional arguments, they
    will be permutated in the same manner as <i>arr</i>. See
    <ref to=functions> for more details.

<dt><tt>array uniq(array <i>a</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns a copy of the array <i>a</i> with all duplicate
    elements removed. Note that this function can return the elements
    in any order.
</dl>

<section title="mapping">
Mappings are are really just more generic arrays. However, they are slower
and use more memory than arrays, so they cannot replace arrays completely.
What makes mappings special is that they can be indexed on other things than
integers. We can imagine that a mapping looks like this:
<p>
<center>
<image xfig=mapping><br>
fig 4.2
</center>
<p>
Each index-value pair is floating around freely inside the mapping. There is
exactly one value for each index. We also have a (magical) lookup function.
This lookup function can find any index in the mapping very quickly. Now, if
the mapping is called <i>m</i> and we index it like this:
<tt><i>m</i> [ <i>i</i> ]</tt> the lookup function will quickly find the index
<i>i</i> in the mapping and return the corresponding value. If the index is 
not found, zero is returned instead. 
If we on the other hand assign an index in the mapping the value will
instead be overwritten with the new value. If the index is not found when
assigning, a new index-value pair will be added to the mapping.
Writing a constant mapping is easy:
<pre>
	([ ])       // Empty mapping
	([ 1:2 ])   // Mapping with one index-value pair, the 1 is the index
	([ "one":1, "two":2 ]) // Mapping which maps words to numbers
	([ 1:({2.0}), "":([]), ]) // Mapping with lots of different types
</pre>
<p>
As with arrays, mappings can contain any type. The main difference is that
the index can be any type too. Also note that the index-value pairs in a
mapping are not stored in a specific order. You can not refer to the
fourteenth key-index pair, since there is no way of telling which one is
the fourteenth. Because of this, you cannot use the range operator on
mappings.
<p>
The following operators and functions are important:
<dl>
<dt> indexing ( <tt><i>m</i> [ <i>ind</i> ]</tt> )
<dd> As discussed above, indexing is used to retrieve, store and add values
     to the mapping.
<dt> addition, subtraction, union, intersection and xor
<dd> All these operators works exactly as on arrays, with the difference that
     they operate on the indices. In those cases when the value can come from
     either mapping, it will be taken from the right side of the operator.
     This makes it easier to add new values to a mapping with <tt>+=</tt>.
     Some examples:<br>
     <tt>([1:3, 3:1]) + ([2:5, 3:7])</tt> returns <tt>([1:3, 2:5, 3:7 ])</tt><br>
     <tt>([1:3, 3:1]) - ([2:5, 3:7])</tt> returns <tt>([1:3])</tt><br>
     <tt>([1:3, 3:1]) | ([2:5, 3:7])</tt> returns <tt>([1:3, 2:5, 3:7 ])</tt><br>
     <tt>([1:3, 3:1]) &amp; ([2:5, 3:7])</tt> returns <tt>([3:7])</tt><br>
     <tt>([1:3, 3:1]) ^ ([2:5, 3:7])</tt> returns <tt>([1:3, 2:5])</tt><br>

<dt> same ( <tt><i>a</i> == <i>b</i></tt> )
<dd> Returns 1 if <i>a</i> is <b>the same</b> mapping as <i>b</i>, 0 otherwise.

<dt> not same ( <tt><i>a</i> != <i>b</i></tt> )
<dd> Returns 0 if <i>a</i> is <b>the same</b> mapping as <i>b</i>, 1 otherwise.

<dt><tt>array indices(mapping <i>m</i>)</tt>
<dd><tt>Indices</tt> returns an array containing all the indices in the mapping <i>m</i>.

<dt><tt>void m_delete(mapping <i>m</i>, mixed <i>ind</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function removes the index-value pair with the index <i>ind</i> from the mapping <i>m</i>.

<dt><tt>int mappingp(mixed <i>m</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns 1 if <i>m</i> is a mapping, 0 otherwise.

<dt><tt>mapping mkmapping(array <i>ind</i>, array <i>val</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function constructs a mapping from the two arrays <i>ind</i> and
    <i>val</i>. Element 0 in <i>ind</i> and element 0 in <i>val</i> becomes
    one index-value pair. Element 1 in <i>ind</i> and element 1 in <i>val</i>
    becomes another index-value pair, and so on..

<dt><tt>mapping replace(mapping <i>m</i>, mixed <i>from</i>, mixed <i>to</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function creates a copy of the mapping <i>m</i> with all values equal to <i>from</i> replaced by <i>to</i>.

<dt><tt>mixed search(mapping <i>m</i>, mixed <i>val</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function returns the index of the 'first' index-value pair which has the value <i>val</i>.

<dt><tt>int sizeof(mapping <i>m</i>)</tt>
<dd><tt>Sizeof</tt> returns how many index-value pairs there are in the mapping.

<dt><tt>array values(mapping <i>m</i>)</tt>
<dd>This function does the same as <tt>indices</tt>, but returns an array with all the values instead. If <tt>indices</tt> and <tt>values</tt> are called on the same mapping after each other, without any other mapping operations in between, the returned arrays will be in the same order. They can in turn be used as arguments to <tt>mkmapping</tt> to rebuild the mapping <i>m</i> again.

<dt><tt>int zero_type(mixed t)</tt>
<dd>When indexing a mapping and the index is not found, zero is returned. However, problems can arise if you have also stored zeroes in the mapping. This function allows you to see the difference between the two cases. If <tt>zero_type(<i>m</i> [ <i>ind</i> ])</tt> returns 1, it means that the value was not present
in the mapping. If the value was present in the mapping, <tt>zero_type</tt> will return something else than 1.
</dl>
</section>


<section title="multiset">

A multiset is almost the same thing as a mapping. The difference is that there
are no values:
<p>
<center>
<image xfig=multiset><br>
fig 4.3
</center>
<p>
Instead, the index operator will return 1 if the value was found
in the multiset and 0 if it was not. When assigning an index to a multiset like
this: <tt><i>mset</i>[ <i>ind</i> ] = <i>val</i></tt> the index <i>ind</i>
will be added to the multiset <i>mset</i> if <i>val</i> is <b>true</b>.
Otherwise <i>ind</i> will be removed from the multiset instead.
<p>
Writing a constant multiset is similar to writing an array:
<pre>
	(&lt; &gt;)      // Empty multiset
	(&lt; 17 &gt;)  // Multiset with one index: 17
	(&lt; "", 1, 3.0, 1 &gt;) // Multiset with 3 indices
</pre>
Note that you can actually have more than one of the same index in a multiset. This is
normally not used, but can be practical at times.
</section>

<section title="program" name=programs>

Normally, when we say <b>program</b> we mean something we can execute from
a shell prompt. However, Pike has another meaning for the same word. In Pike
a <tt>program</tt> is the same as a <b>class</b> in C++. A <tt>program</tt>
holds a table of what functions and variables are defined in that program.
It also holds the code itself, debug information and references to other
programs in the form of inherits. A <tt>program</tt> does not hold space
to store any data however.
All the information in a <tt>program</tt> is
gathered when a file or string is run through the Pike compiler. The variable
space needed to execute the code in the program is stored in an <tt>object</tt>
which is the next data type we will discuss. 
<p>
<center>
  <image xfig=program><br>
fig 4.4
</center>
Writing a <tt>program</tt> is easy, in fact, every example we have tried so
far has been a <tt>program</tt>. To load such a program into memory, we can
use <tt>compile_file</tt> which takes a file name, compiles the file
and returns the compiled program. It could look something like this:
<example language=pike>
	program p = compile_file("hello_world.pike");
</example>
You can also use the <b>cast</b> operator like this:
<example language=pike>
	program p = (program) "hello_world";
</example>
This will also load the program <tt>hello_world.pike</tt>, the only difference
is that it will cache the result so that next time you do <tt>(program)"hello_world"</tt> you will receive the _same_ program. If you call
<tt>compile_file("hello_world.pike")</tt> repeatedly you will get a new program
 each time.
<p>
There is also a way to write programs inside programs with the help of the
<tt>class</tt> keyword:
<pre>
	class <i>class_name</i> {
	  <i>inherits, variables and functions </i>
	}
</pre>
The <tt>class</tt> keyword can be written as a separate entity
outside of all functions, but it is also an expression which returns the
<tt>program</tt> written between the brackets. The <i>class_name</i> is
optional. If used you can later refer to that <tt>program</tt> by the name
<i>class_name</i>.
This is very similar to how classes are written in C++ and can be used
in much the same way. It can also be used to create <b>structs</b>
(or records if you program Pascal).
 Let's look at an example:
<example language=pike>
	class record {
	  string title;
	  string artist;
	  array(string) songs;
	}

	array(record) records = ({});

	void add_empty_record()
	{
	  records+=({ record() });
	}

	void show_record(record rec)
	{
	  write("Record name: "+rec-&gt;title+"\n");
	  write("Artist: "+rec-&gt;artist+"\n");
	  write("Songs:\n");
	  foreach(rec-&gt;songs, string song)
	    write("   "+song+"\n");
	}
</example>
This could be a small part of a better record register program. It is not
a complete executable program in itself.  In this example we create a
<tt>program</tt> called <tt>record</tt> which has three identifiers.
In <tt>add_empty_record</tt> a new object is created
by calling <tt>record</tt>. This is called <b>cloning</b> and it
allocates space to store the variables defined in the <tt>class record</tt>.
<tt>Show_record</tt> takes one of the records created in
<tt>add_empty_record</tt> and shows the contents of it. As you can see, the arrow operator
is used to access the data allocated in <tt>add_empty_record</tt>.
If you do not understand this section I suggest you go on and read the
next section about <tt>objects</tt> and then come back and read this
section again.
<p>

<dl>
<dt> cloning
<dd> To create a data area for a <tt>program</tt> you need to instantiate or
     <b>clone</b> the program. This is accomplished by using a pointer
     to the <tt>program</tt> as if it was a function and call it. That
     creates a new object and calls the function <tt>create</tt> in the
     new object with the arguments. It is also possible to use the
     functions <tt>new()</tt> and <tt>clone()</tt> which do exactly the
     same thing except you can use a string to specify what program you
     want to clone.
<dt> compiling
<dd> All programs are generated by compiling a string. The string may of
     course be read from a file. For this purpose there are three functions:
<example language=pike meta=p,filename>
	program compile(string p);
	program compile_file(string filename);
	program compile_string(string p, string filename);
</example>
     <tt>compile_file</tt> simply reads the file given as argument, compiles
     it and returns the resulting program. <tt>compile_string</tt> instead
     compiles whatever is in the string <i>p</i>. The second argument,
     <i>filename</i>, is only used in debug printouts when an error occurs
     in the newly made program. Both <tt>compile_file</tt> and
     <tt>compile_string</tt> calls <tt>compile</tt> to actually compile
     the string after calling <tt>cpp</tt> on it.

<dt> casting
<dd> Another way of compiling files to program is to use the <b>cast</b>
     operator. Casting a string to the type <tt>program</tt> calls a function
     in the master object which will compile the program in question for you.
     The master also keeps the program in a cache, so if you later need the
     same program again it will not be re-compiled.
<dt> <tt>int programp(mixed <i>p</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns 1 if <i>p</i> is a program, 0 otherwise.
<dt> comparisons
<dd> As with all data types <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> can be used to
     see if two programs are the same or not.
</dl>
<p>
The following operators and functions are important:
<dl>
<dt> cloning ( <tt><i>p</i> ( <i>args</i> )</tt> )
<dd> Creates an object from a program. Discussed in the next section.

<dt> indexing ( <tt><i>p</i> [ <i>string</i> ]</tt>, or
                <tt><i>p</i> -> <i>identifier</i></tt> )
<dd> Retreives the value of the named constant from a program.

<dt> <tt>array(string) indices(program <i>p</i>)</tt>
<dd> Returns an array with the names of all non-static constants in the
     program.

<dt> <tt>array(mixed) values(program <i>p</i>)</tt>
<dd> Returns an array with the values of all non-static constants in the
     program.
</dl>

</section>


<section title="object">
Although programs are absolutely necessary for any application you might
want to write, they are not enough. A <tt>program</tt> doesn't have anywhere
to store data, it just merely outlines how to store data. To actually store
the data you need an <tt>object</tt>. Objects are basically a chunk of memory
with a reference to the program from which it was cloned. Many objects can
be made from one program. The <tt>program</tt> outlines where in the object
different variables are stored.
<center>
  <image xfig=object><br>
fig 4.5
</center>
Each object has its own set of variables, and when calling a function in that
object, that function will operate on those variables. If we take a look at
the short example in the section about programs, we see that it would be
better to write it like this:
<example language=pike>
	class record {
	  string title;
	  string artist;
	  array(string) songs;

	  void show()
	  {
	    write("Record name: "+title+"\n");
	    write("Artist: "+artist+"\n");
            write("Songs:\n");
            foreach(songs, string song)
	      write("   "+song+"\n");
	  }
	}

	array(record) records = ({});

	void add_empty_record()
	{
	  records+=({ record() });
	}

	void show_record(object rec)
	{
	  rec-&gt;show();
	}
</example>
Here we can clearly see how the function <tt>show</tt> prints the
contents of the variables in that object. In essence, instead of accessing
the data in the object with the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator, we call a function
in the object and have it write the information itself. This type of
programming is very flexible, since we can later change how <tt>record</tt>
stores its data, but we do not have to change anything outside of
the <tt>record</tt> program.
<p>
Functions and operators relevant to objects:
<dl>
<dt> indexing
<dd> Objects can be indexed on strings to access identifiers. If the identifier
     is a variable, the value can also be set using indexing. If the identifier
     is a function, a pointer to that function will be returned. If the
     identifier is a constant, the value of that constant will be returned.
     Note that the <tt>-&gt;</tt> operator is actually the same as indexing.
     This means that <tt>o-&gt;foo</tt> is the same as <tt>o["foo"]</tt>
<dt> cloning
<dd> As discussed in the section about programs, cloning a program can be done
     in two different ways:
     <ol>
     <li> Use a pointer to the program as a function and call it.
     <li> Use the functions <tt>new</tt> or <tt>clone</tt>. (They are the same function.)
     </ol>
     Whenever you clone an object, all the global variables will be
     initialized. After that the function <tt>create</tt> will be called
     with any arguments you call the program with.
<dt> <tt>void destruct(object <i>o</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function invalidates all references to the object <i>o</i> and
     frees all variables in that object. This function is also called when
     <i>o</i> runs out of references. If there is a function named
     <tt>destroy</tt> in the object, it will be called before the actual
     destruction of the object.
<dt> <tt>array(string) indices(object <i>o</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns a list of all identifiers in the object <i>o</i>.
<dt> <tt>program object_program(object <i>o</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns the program from which <i>o</i> was cloned.
<dt> <tt>int objectp(mixed <i>o</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns 1 if <i>o</i> is an object, 0 otherwise.
     Note that if <i>o</i> has been destructed, this function will return 0.
<dt> <tt>object this_object()</tt>
<dd> This function returns the object in which the interpreter is currently
     executing.
<dt> <tt>array values(object <i>o</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns the same as <tt>rows(o,indices(o))</tt>.
     That means it returns all the values of the identifiers in the
     object <i>o</i>.
<dt> comparing
<dd> As with all data types <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> can be used to
     check if two objects are the same or not.
</dl>
</section>

<section title="function">

When indexing an object on a string, and that string is the name of a function
in the object a <tt>function</tt> is returned. Despite its name, a
<tt>function</tt> is really a <b>function pointer</b>.
<center>
  <image xfig=function><br>
fig 4.6
</center>

When the function pointer is called, the interpreter sets
<tt>this_object()</tt> to the object in which the function is located and
proceeds to execute the function it points to. Also note that function pointers
can be passed around just like any other data type:
<example language=pike>
	int foo() { return 1; }
	function bar() { return foo; }
	int gazonk() { return foo(); }
	int teleledningsanka() { return bar()(); }
</example>
In this example, the function bar returns a pointer to the function
<tt>foo</tt>. No indexing is necessary since the function <tt>foo</tt> is
located in the same object. The function <tt>gazonk</tt> simply calls
<tt>foo</tt>. However, note that the word <tt>foo</tt> in that function
is an expression returning a function pointer that is then called. To
further illustrate this, <tt>foo</tt> has been replaced by <tt>bar()</tt>
in the function <tt>teleledningsanka</tt>.
<p>
For convenience, there is also a simple way to write a function inside another
function. To do this you use the <tt>lambda</tt> keyword.  The
syntax is the same as for a normal function, except you write
<tt>lambda</tt> instead of the function name:
<example language=pike meta=types,statements>
	lambda ( types ) { statements }
</example>
The major difference is that this is an expression that can be used inside
an other function. Example:
<example language=pike>
	function bar() { return lambda() { return 1; }; )
</example>
This is the same as the first two lines in the previous example, the keyword
<tt>lambda</tt> allows you to write the function inside <tt>bar</tt>.
<p>
Note that unlike C++ and Java you can not use function overloading in Pike.
This means that you cannot have one function called 'foo' which takes an
integer argument and another function 'foo' which takes a float argument.
<p>
This is what you can do with a function pointer.
<dl>
<dt> calling ( <i>f</i> ( mixed ... <i>args</i> ) )
<dd> As mentioned earlier, all function pointers can be called. In this example
     the function <i>f</i> is called with the arguments <i>args</i>.

<dt> <tt>string function_name(function <i>f</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns the name of the function <i>f</i> is pointing at.

<dt> <tt>object function_object(function <i>f</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns the object the function <i>f</i> is located in.

<dt> <tt>int functionp(mixed <i>f</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function returns 1 if <i>f</i> is a <tt>function</tt>, 0 otherwise.
     If <i>f</i> is located in a destructed object, 0 is returned.

<dt> <tt>function this_function()</tt>
<dd> This function returns a pointer to the function it is called from.
     This is normally only used with <b>lambda</b> functions because they
     do not have a name.
</dl>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Sharing data">
As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the assignment operator
(<tt>=</tt>) does not copy anything when you use it on a pointer type.
Instead it just creates another reference to the memory object.
In most situations this does not present a problem, and it speeds up
Pike's performance. However, you must be aware of this when programming.
This can be illustrated with an example:
<example language=pike>
	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  array(string) tmp;
	  tmp=argv;
	  argv[0]="Hello world.\n";
	  write(tmp[0]);
	}
</example>
This program will of course write <tt>Hello world.</tt>
<p>
Sometimes you want to create a copy of a mapping, array or object. To
do so you simply call <tt>copy_value</tt> with whatever you want to copy
as argument. Copy_value is recursive, which means that if you have an
array containing arrays, copies will be made of all those arrays.
<p>
If you don't want to copy recursively, or you know you don't have to
copy recursively, you can use the plus operator instead. For instance,
to create a copy of an array you simply add an empty array to it, like this:
<tt>copy_of_arr = arr + ({});</tt> If you need to copy a mapping you use
an empty mapping, and for a multiset you use an empty multiset.
</section>


<section title="Writing data types">

When declaring a variable, you also have to specify what type of variable
it is. For most types, such as <tt>int</tt> and <tt>string</tt> this is
very easy. But there are much more interesting ways to declare variables
than that, let's look at a few examples:
<pre>
	int x; // x is an integer
	int|string x; // x is a string or an integer
	array(string) x; // x is an array of strings
	array x; // x is an array of mixed
	mixed x; // x can be any type
	string *x; // x is an array of strings

	 // x is a mapping from int to string
	mapping(string:int) x;

	// x implements Stdio.File
	Stdio.File x;

	// x implements Stdio.File
	object(Stdio.File) x;

	// x is a function that takes two integer
	// arguments and returns a string
	function(int,int:string) x;

	// x is a function taking any amount of
	// integer arguments and returns nothing.
	function(int...:void) x;

	// x is ... complicated
	mapping(string:function(string|int...:mapping(string:array(string)))) x;
</pre>
As you can see there are some interesting ways to specify types.
Here is a list of what is possible:
<dl>
<dt> <tt>mixed</tt>
<dd> This means that the variable can contain any type, or the
	function return any value
<dt> <tt>array( <i>type</i> )</tt>
<dd> This means an array of elements with the type <i>type</i>.
<dt> <tt><i>type</i> *</tt>
<dd> This also means an array of elements with the type <i>type</i>.
<dt> <tt>mapping( <i>key type</i> : <i>value type</i> )</tt>
<dd> This is a mapping where the keys are of type <i>key type</i> and the
      values of <i>value type</i>.
<dt> <tt>multiset ( <i>type</i> )</tt>
<dd> This means a multiset containing values of the type <i>type</i>.
<dt> <tt>object ( <i>program</i> )</tt>
<dd> This means an object which 'implements'  the specified program. The
     <i>program</i> can be a class, a constant, or a string.
     If the program is a string it will be casted to a program first.
     See the documentation for <tt>inherit</tt> for more information
     about this casting. The compiler will assume that any function
     or variable accessed in this object has the same type information
     as that function or variable has in <i>program</i>.
<dt> <tt><i>program</i></tt>
<dd> This too means 'an object which implements <i>program</i>'.
     <i>program</i> can be a class or a constant.
<dt> <tt>function( <i>argument types</i> : <i>return type</i> )</tt>
<dd> This is a function taking the specified arguments and returning
     <i>return type</i>. The <i>argument types</i> is a comma separated
     list of types that specify the arguments. The argument list can also
     end with <tt>...</tt> to signify that there can be any amount of the
     last type.
<dt> <tt><i>type1</i> | <i>type2</i></tt>
<dd> This means either <i>type1</i> or <i>type2</i>
<dt> <tt>void</tt>
<dd> Void can only be used in certain places, if used as return type for a
     function it means that the function does not return a value. If used
     in the argument list for a function it means that that argument can
     be omitted. Example: <tt>function(int|void:void)</tt> this means a
     function that may or may not take an integer argument and does not
     return a value.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Operators" name=operators>

To make it easier to write Pike, and to make the code somewhat shorter,
some functions can be called with just one or two characters in the code.
These functions are called <b>operators</b> and we have already seen how
they work in plenty of examples. In this chapter I will describe in detail
what they do. The operators are divided into categories depending on their
function, but beware that some operators have meanings that go way beyond
the scope of the category they are in.

<section title="Arithmetic operators">
The arithmetic operators are the simplest ones, since they work just like
you remember from math in school. The arithmetic operators are:
<center>
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>			<th>Function</th>	<th>Syntax</th>		<th>Identifier</th>	<th>Returns</th></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`+>	<td>Addition</td>	<td><tt>a + b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`+</tt></td>	<td>the sum of a and b</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`->	<td>Subtraction</td>	<td><tt>a - b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`-</tt></td>	<td>b subtracted from a</td></anchor></tr>
<tr>			<td>Negation</td>	<td><tt>- a</tt></td>	<td><tt>`-</tt></td>	<td>minus a</td></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`*>	<td>Multiplication</td>	<td><tt>a * b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`*</tt></td>	<td>a multiplied by b</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`/>	<td>Division</td>	<td><tt>a / b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`/</tt></td>	<td>a divided by b</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`%>	<td>Modulo</td>		<td><tt>a % b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`%</tt></td>	<td>the remainder of a division between a and b</td></anchor></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
The third column, "Identifier" is the name of the function that actually
evaluates the operation. For instance, <tt>a + b</tt> can also be written
as <tt>`+(a, b)</tt>. I will show you how useful this can be at the end
of this chapter.
<p>
When applied to integers or floats these operators do exactly what they
are supposed to do. The only operator in the list not known from basic
math is the <b>modulo</b> operator. The modulo operator returns the
remainder from an integer division. It is the same as calculating
<tt>a - floor(a / b) * b</tt>. <tt>floor</tt> rounds the value down to
closest lower integer value. Note that the call to <tt>floor</tt> isn't
needed when operating on integers, since dividing two integers will return
the result as an integer and it is always rounded down. For instance,
<tt>8 / 3</tt> would return <tt>2</tt>.
<p>
If all arguments to the operator are integers, the
result will also be an integer. If one is a float and the other is
an integer, the result will be a float. If both arguments are float,
the result will of course be a float.
<p>
However, there are more types in Pike than integers and floats. Here is
the complete list of combinations of types you can use with these operators:

<center>

<section title="Comparison operators">
The arithmetic operators would be hard to use for anything interesting
without the ability to compare the results to each other.
For this purpose there are six comparison operators:

<center>
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>			<th>Function</th>		 <th>Syntax</th>	<th>Identifier</th> <th>Returns</th></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`==>	<td>Same</td>                    <td><tt>a == b</tt></td>   <td><tt>`==</tt></td>   <td>1 if a is the same value as b, 0 otherwise</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`!=>	<td>Not same</td>                <td><tt>a != b</tt></td>   <td><tt>`!=</tt></td>   <td>0 if a is the same value as b, 1 otherwise</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`>">	<td>Greater than</td>            <td><tt>a &gt; b</tt></td> <td><tt>`&gt; </tt></td><td>1 if a is greater than b, 0 otherwise</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`>=">	<td>Greater than or equal to</td><td><tt>a &gt;= b</tt></td><td><tt>`&gt;=</tt></td><td>1 if a is greater to or equal to b, 0 otherwise</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`<">	<td>Lesser than</td>             <td><tt>a &lt; b</tt></td> <td><tt>`&lt; </tt></td><td>1 if a is lesser than b, 0 otherwise</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`<=">	<td>Lesser than or equal to</td> <td><tt>a &lt;= b</tt></td><td><tt>`&lt;=</tt></td><td>1 if a is lesser than or equal to b, 0 otherwise</td></anchor></tr>
</table>
<p>
</center>

The <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> operators can be used on any type. For two
values to be <b>same</b> they must be the same type. Therefore 1 and 1.0 are
not <b>same</b>. Also, for two values of <b>pointer types</b> to be the same
the two values must be pointers to the same object. It is not enough that
the two objects are of the same size and contain the same data.
<p>
The other operators in the table above can only be used with integers, floats
and strings. If you compare an integer with a float, the int will be promoted
to a float before the comparison. When comparing strings, lexical order is
used and the values of the environment variables <tt>LC_CTYPE</tt> and
<tt>LC_LANG</tt> are respected.
</section>

<section title="Logical operators">
Logical operators are operators that operate with truth values. In Pike any value
except zero is considered <b>true</b>. Logical operators are a very basic part
of Pike. They can also decide which arguments to evaluate and which not to
evaluate. Because of this the logical operators do not have any identifiers and
can not be called as normal functions. There are four logical operators:

<center>
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Function</th>	<th>Syntax</th>	<th>Returns</th></tr>
<tr><td>And</td>	<td><tt>a &amp;&amp; b</tt></td> <td>If a is false, a is returned and b is not evaluated. Otherwise, b is returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Or</td>		<td><tt>a || b</tt></td> 	<td>If a is true, a is returned and b is not evaluated. Otherwise, b is returned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Not</td>	<td><tt>! a</tt></td>		<td>Returns 0 if a is true, 1 otherwise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>If-else</td>	<td><tt>a ? b : c</tt></td>	<td>If a is true, b is returned and c is not evaluated. Otherwise c is returned and b is not evaluated.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
</section>

<section title="Bitwise/set operators">
These operators are used to manipulate bits as members in sets.
They can also manipulate arrays, multisets and mappings as sets.

<center>
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>			<th>Function</th>		<th>Syntax</th>			<th>Identifier</th>		<th>Returns</th></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`<<">	<td>Shift left</td>		<td><tt>a &lt;&lt; b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`&lt;&lt;</tt></td>	<td>Multiplies a by 2 b times.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`>>">	<td>Shift right</td>		<td><tt>a &gt;&gt; b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`&gt;&gt;</tt></td>	<td>Divides a by 2 b times.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`~>	<td>Inverse (not)</td>		<td><tt>~ a</tt></td>		<td><tt>`~</tt></td>		<td>Returns -1-a.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`&>	<td>Intersection (and)</td>	<td><tt>a &amp; b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`&amp;</tt></td>	<td>All elements present in both a and b.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`|>	<td>Union (or)</td>		<td><tt>a | b</tt></td>		<td><tt>`|</tt></td>		<td>All elements present in a or b.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`^>	<td>Symmetric difference (xor)</td><td><tt>a ^ b</tt></td>	<td><tt>`^</tt></td>		<td>All elements present in a or b, but not present in both.</td></anchor></tr>
</table>
<p>
</center>

The first three operators can only be used with integers and should be
pretty obvious.

The other three, intersection, union and symmetric difference, can be used with
integers, arrays, multisets and mappings. When used with integers, these
operators considers each bit in the integer a separate element. If you do
not know about how bits in integers work I suggest you go look it up in some other
programming book or just don't use these operators on integers.
<p>
When intersection, union or symmetric difference is used on an array each element
in the array is considered by itself. So intersecting two arrays will result
in an array with all elements that are present in both arrays. Example:
<tt>({7,6,4,3,2,1}) &amp; ({1, 23, 5, 4, 7})</tt> will return
<tt>({7,4,1})</tt>. The order of the elements in the returned array will
always be taken from the left array. Elements in multisets are treated
the same as elements in arrays. When doing a set operation on a mapping
however, only the indices are considered. The values are just copied with
the indices. If a particular index is present in both the right and left
argument to a set operator, the one from the right side will be used.
Example: <tt>([1:2]) | ([1:3])</tt> will return <tt>([1:3])</tt>.
</section>

<section title="Indexing">
The index and range operators are used to retrieve information from a
complex data type.

<center>
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>			<th>Function</th>	<th>Syntax</th>				<th>Identifier</th>	<th>Returns</th></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`[]>	<td>Index</td>		<td><tt>a [ b ]</tt></td>		<td><tt>`[]</tt></td>	<td>Returns the index b from a.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`->">	<td>Lookup</td>		<td><tt>a -&gt;<i>identifier</i></tt></td><td><tt>`-&gt;</tt></td><td>Looks up the identifier. Same as a["<i>identifier</i>"].</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`[]=>	<td>Assign index</td>	<td><tt>a [ b ] = c</tt></td>		<td><tt>`[]=;</tt></td><td>Sets the index b in a to c.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name="`->="><td>Assign index</td>	<td><tt>a -&gt;<i>identifier</i> = c</tt></td><td><tt>`-&gt;=</tt></td><td>Sets the index "<i>identifier</i>" in a to c.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`[..]>	<td>Range</td>		<td><tt>a [ b .. c ]</tt></td>		<td><tt>`[..]</tt></td>	<td>Returns a slice of a starting at the index b and ending at c.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr>			<td>Range</td>		<td><tt>a [ .. c ]</tt></td>		<td><tt>`[..]</tt></td>	<td>Returns a slice of a starting at the beginning of a and ending at c.</td></tr>
<tr>			<td>Range</td>		<td><tt>a [ b .. ]</tt></td>		<td><tt>`[..]</tt></td>	<td>Returns a slice of a from the index b to the end of a.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
</center>

The index operator can be written in two different ways. It can be
written as <tt><i>ob</i> [ <i>index</i> ]</tt> or
<tt><i>ob</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i></tt>. However, the latter syntax is
equal to <tt><i>ob</i> [ "<i>identifier</i>" ]</tt>.

You can only
index strings, arrays, mapping, multisets and objects, and some of these
can only be indexed on certain things as shown in this list:
<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<th>Operation</th> <th>Returns</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt><i>string</i>[<i>int</i>]</tt></td><td>Returns the ascii value of the Nth character in the string.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt><i>array</i>[<i>int</i>]</tt></td><td>Return the element in the array corresponding to the integer.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt><i>array</i>[<i>int</i>]=<i>mixed</i></tt></td><td>Sets the element in the array to the mixed value.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>mapping</i>[<i>mixed</i>]<br>
  <i>mapping</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i>
     </tt></td><td>Returns the value associated with the index, 0 if it is not found.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>mapping</i>[<i>mixed</i>]=<i>mixed</i><br>
  <i>mapping</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i>=<i>mixed</i>
     </tt></td><td>Associate the second mixed value with the first mixed value.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>multiset</i>[<i>mixed</i>]<br>
  <i>multiset</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i>
     </tt></td><td>Returns 1 if the index (the value between the brackets) is present in the multiset, 0 otherwise.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>multiset</i>[<i>mixed</i>]=<i>mixed</i><br>
  <i>multiset</i>-&gt;<i>identifier=<i>mixed</i></i>
     </tt></td><td>If the mixed value is <b>true</b> the index is added to the multiset. Otherwise the index is removed from the multiset.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>object</i>[<i>string</i>]<br>
  <i>object</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i><br>
    </tt></td><td>Returns the value of the named identifier in the object.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>object</i>[<i>string</i>]=<i>mixed</i><br>
  <i>object</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i>=<i>mixed</i><br>
    </tt></td><td>Set the given identifier in the object to the mixed value. Only works if the identifier references a variable in the object.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt>
  <i>program</i>[<i>string</i>]<br>
  <i>program</i>-&gt;<i>identifier</i><br>
    </tt></td><td>Returns the value of the named constant identifier
                  in the program.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><tt><i>string</i>[<i>int</i>..<i>int</i>]</tt></td><td>Returns a piece of the string.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt><i>array</i>[<i>int</i>..<i>int</i>]</tt></td><td>Returns a slice of the array.</td>
</tr>
</table>

</center>

<p>
When indexing an <tt>array</tt> or <tt>string</tt> it is sometimes convenient
to access index from the end instead of from the beginning. This function
can be performed by using a negative index. Thus <tt> arr[-i] </tt> is the
same as <tt>arr[sizeof(arr)-i]</tt>. Note however that this behavior does
not apply to the range operator. Instead the range operator clamps it's
arguments to a suitable range. This means that
<tt><i>a</i>[<i>b</i>..<i>c</i>]</tt> will be treated as follows:

<ul>
<li> If <i>b</i> is less than zero, the range will begin at the start
     of the array as if <i>b</i> had been zero.
<li> If <i>b</i> is greater or equal to sizeof(<i>a</i>) an empty array/string
     will be returned.
<li> If <i>c</i> is less than <i>b</i>, an empty array/string will be
     returned.
<li> If <i>c</i> is greater or equal to sizeof(<i>a</i>) the range will
     continue to the end of the array/string.
<li> No errors are generated in any of the above cases.
</ul>

</section>

<!-- FIX ME: tell more about indexing and ranges -->

<section title="The assignment operators">
There is really only one assignment operator, but it can be combined with
lots of other operators to make the code shorter. An assignment looks
like this:
<example language=pike meta=variable,expression>
	variable = expression;
</example>
The <i>variable</i> can be a local variable, a global variable or an index
in an array, object, multiset or mapping. This will of course set the
value stored in <i>variable</i> to <i>expression</i>. Note that the above
is also an expression which returns the value of the <i>expression</i>.
This can be used in some interesting ways:
<example language=pike meta=variable1,variable2,expression>
	variable1 = variable2 = 1; // Assign 1 to both variables
	variable1 =(variable2 = 1); // Same as above

	// Write the value of the expression, if any
	if(variable = expression)
	  write(variable);
</example>
Using assignments like this can however be confusing to novice users, or users
who come from a Pascal or Basic background. Especially the if statement
can be mistaken for <tt>if(<i>variable</i> == <i>expression</i>)</tt> which
would mean something completely different. As I mentioned earlier, the
assignment operator can be combined with another operator to form operators
that modify the contents of a variable instead of just assigning it.
Here is a list of all the combinations:
<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Syntax</th> <th>Same as</th> <th>Function</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> += <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> + <i>expression</i></td><td>Add <i>expression</i> to <i>variable</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> -= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> - <i>expression</i></td><td>Subtract <i>expression</i> from <i>variable</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> *= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> * <i>expression</i></td><td>Multiply <i>variable</i> with <i>expression</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> /= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> / <i>expression</i></td><td>Divide <i>variable</i> by <i>expression</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> %= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> % <i>expression</i></td><td>Modulo <i>variable</i> by <i>expression</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> &lt;&lt;= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> &lt;&lt; <i>expression</i></td><td>Shift <i>variable</i> <i>expression</i> bits left</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> &gt;&gt;= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> &gt;&gt; <i>expression</i></td><td>Shift <i>variable</i> <i>expression</i> bits right</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> |= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> | <i>expression</i></td><td>Or <i>variable</i> with <i>expression</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> &amp;= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> &amp; <i>expression</i></td><td>And <i>variable</i> with <i>expression</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt><i>variable</i> ^= <i>expression</i></tt></td><td> <i>variable</i> = <i>variable</i> ^ <i>expression</i></td><td>Xor <i>variable</i> with <i>expression</i></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
In all of the above expressions <i>variable</i> can also be an element from 
an array, mapping or multiset. Example: <tt>foo["bar"]+=10;</tt>
</section>

<section title="The rest of the operators">
Now there are only a couple of operators left. I have grouped them together
in this section, not because they are not important, but because they do
not fit in any particular categories.

<center>
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Function</th>	<th>Syntax</th>			<th>Identifier</th><th>Returns</th></tr>
<tr><anchor name=`()><td>Calling</td><td><tt>a ( <i>args</i> )</tt></td><td><tt>`()</tt></td><td>Calls the function a.</td></anchor></tr>
<tr><td>splice</td>	<td><tt>@ <i>a</i></tt></td>	<td>none</td>	<td>Sends each element in the array a as an individual argument to a function call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Increment</td>	<td><tt>++ a</tt></td>		<td>none</td>	<td>Increments a and returns the new value of a.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Decrement</td>	<td><tt>-- a</tt></td>		<td>none</td>	<td>Decrements a and returns the new value of a.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post increment</td><td><tt>a ++</tt></td>	<td>none</td>	<td>Increments a and returns the old value of a.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post decrement</td><td><tt>a --</tt></td>	<td>none</td>	<td>Decrements a and returns the old value of a.</td></tr>
<tr><td>casting</td>	<td><tt>(<i>type</i>) a</tt></td><td>none</td>	<td>Tries to convert a into a value of the specified type.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Null</td>	<td><tt>a, b</tt></td>		<td>none</td>	<td>Evaluates a and b, then returns b.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
</center>

The most important of these operators is the calling operator. It is used
to call functions. The operator itself is just a set of parenthesis placed
after the expression that returns the function. Any arguments to the function
should be placed between the parenthesis, separated by commas. We have
already seen many examples of this operator, although you might not have
realized it was an operator at the time. The function call operator can
do more than just calling functions though; if the 'function' is in fact
an array, the operator will loop over the array and call each element in
the array and returns an array with the results.
<!-- In fact, <tt>({ foo, bar, gazonk }) (1, 2, 3)</tt> is the same as <tt>map(({ foo, bar, gazonk }), call_function, 1, 2, 3)</tt>. -->
If on the other hand, the 'function' is a program, the operator will
clone an object from the program and call create() in the new object
with the arguments given. In fact, the function <tt>clone</tt> is
implemented like this:
<p>
<example language=pike>
	object clone(mixed p, mixed ... args) { ( (program)p )(@args); }
</example>
<p>
On the subject of function calls, the splice operator should also be mentioned.
The splice operator is an at sign in front of an expression. The expression
should always be an array. The splice operator sends each of the elements
in the array as a separate argument to the function call. The splice operator
can only be used in an argument list for a function call.
<p>
Then there are the increment and decrement operators. The increment and
decrement operators are somewhat limited: they can only be used on
integers. They provide a short and fast way to add or subtract one
to an integer. If the operator is written before the variable
(<tt>++<i>a</i></tt>) the returned value will be what the variable
is after the operator has added/subtracted one to it. If the operator
is after the variable (<tt><i>a</i>++</tt>) it will instead return the
value of the variable before it was incremented/decremented.
<p>
Casting is used to convert one type to another, not all casts are
possible. Here is a list of all casts that actually _do_ anything:
<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>casting from</th><th>to</th><th>operation</th></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>string</td><td>Convert the int to ASCII representation</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>string</td><td>Convert the float to ASCII representation</td></tr>
<tr><td>string</td><td>int</td><td>Convert decimal, octal or hexadecimal number to an int. Note that this will only work with decimal numbers in future versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>string</td><td>float</td><td>Convert ASCII number to a float.</td></tr>
<tr><td>string</td><td>program</td><td>String is a filename, compile the file and return the program. Results are cached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>string</td><td>object</td><td>This first casts the string to a program, (see above) and then clones the result. Results are cached.</td></tr>
<tr><td>object</td><td><i>type</i></td><td>This calls the function 'cast' with a string containing the type as an argument.</td></tr>
<tr><td>string</td><td>array</td><td>Same as doing <tt>values(<i>string</i>)</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>array(int)</td><td>string</td><td>This does the inverse of the operation above. Ie. it constructs a string from an array of integers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>array</td><td>array(<i>type</i>)</td><td>This recursively casts all values in the array to <i>type</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>mapping</td><td>array</td><td>Same as <tt>Array.transpose(({indices(<i>mapping</i>),values(<i>mapping</i>))</tt>. Example: <tt>(array)([1:2,3:4])</tt> will return <tt>({ ({1,2}), ({3,4}) })</tt> </td></tr>
<tr><td>multiset</td><td>array</td><td>Same as doing <tt>indices(<i>multiset</i>)</tt>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>float</td><td>Returns a float with the same value as the integer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>int</td><td>Returns the integer closest to the float.</td></tr>
<tr><td>function</td><td>object</td><td>Same as <tt>function_object(<i>function</i>)</tt>.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
You can also use the cast operator to tell the compiler things.
If <tt>a</tt> is a variable of type mixed  containing an int, then the
expression <tt>(int)a</tt> can be used instead of <tt>a</tt> and that will
tell the compiler that the type of that expression is <tt>int</tt>.
<p>
Last, and in some respect least, is the comma operator. It doesn't do
much. In fact, it simply evaluates the two arguments and then returns
the right hand one. This operator is mostly useful to produce smaller code,
or to make defines that can be used in expressions.
<p>
</section>

<section title="Operator precedence">
When evaluating an expression, you can always use parenthesis to tell
the compiler in which order to evaluate things. Normally, the compiler
will evaluate things from left to right, but it will evaluate operators
with higher priority before those with lower. The following table shows
the relative priority of all the operators in descending order:
<p>
<center>

</section>

<section title="Operator functions">
As mentioned earlier <tt>a + b</tt> can just as well be written as
<tt>`+(a, b)</tt>. Together with the function <tt>map</tt> which
calls a function for every index in an array and the splice operator
this can be used to create some very very fast and compact code. Let's
look at some examples:
<dl>
<dt> <tt>map(arr, `-)</tt>
<dd> This will return an array with each element negated.
<dt> <tt>map(text/"\n",`/," ")</tt>
<dd> This will divide a text into lines, each line will then be mapped
     through <tt>`/</tt> and divided into an array of words.
<dt> <tt>`+(0, @arr)</tt>
<dd> This will add all the integers in the array <tt>arr</tt> together.
<dt> <tt>int abs(int a) { return ( a>0 ? `+ : `-)(a); }</tt>
<dd> This is a rather absurd but working function which will return the
     absolute value of a.

<chapter title="Object orientation">
As mentioned several times, Pike is object oriented. This does not mean that
it is identical to C++ in any way. Pike uses a less strict approach to
object orientation which creates a more relaxed programming style. If you
have never come in contact with object oriented programming before, be
warned that the ideas expressed in Pike and in this chapter are my own and
do not necessarily reflect what other people think about object
oriented programming.

<section title="Terminology">
As mentioned before, Pike uses a different terminology than C++ does.
This has historic reasons, but might be changed in the future. In
the meantime, you might benefit from this mini-dictionary which translates
Pike-ish terms to C++-ish terms:
<dl>
<dt> a <i>class</i> <dd> a class
<dt> a <i>clone</i> <dd> an instance of a class
<dt> to <i>clone</i> <dd> to create an instance
<dt> an <i>object</i> <dd> an instance of a class
<dt> a <i>program</i> <dd> a class
</dl>
</section>

<section title="The approach">
Think of the data type <tt>program</tt> as an executable file. Then we clone this
program and create an object. The object is then a running program. The
object has its own data and its own functions, however, it can work
together with other programs by calling functions in those objects.
The functions can be thought of as message carriers, TCP sockets or
just a way for programs to communicate.

<!-- FIX ME: do something about the following sentence? -->
Now we have a running system with
many running programs, each performing only the task it was designed for.
<p>
This analogy has one major flaw, when running programs in UNIX they actually
run simultaneously. UNIX is <i>multitasking</i>, Pike is not. When one
object is executing code, all the other objects has to wait until they
are called. An exception is if you are using <b>threads</b> as will be
discussed in a later chapter.
</section>

<section title="How does this help?">
Ok, why is it a good idea to use object oriented programming? Well
if you believe what you hear, the biggest advantage is that you can re-use
your code in several projects. In my experience this is not the case.
<p>
In my experience, the advantages of object oriented programming are:

<dd>Using <b>The approach</b> makes it easy to divide a project into smaller
    pieces, these pieces are usually easier to write than the whole.

<dt>Local data scope
<dd>This is a very nifty thing with object oriented programs. If your program
    uses several files, windows, stacks, TCP connections or whatever, you
    simply write a <tt>program</tt> that handles one such file, window,
    stack or TCP connection. If correctly written, you can then just create
    many clones of that program. 

<dt>Using the same interface to different objects
<dd>I can write a function that take a stream as an argument and writes
    data to this stream. Later I might wish to write this data to a window
    instead. I can then create an object that has the same methods as a stream
    (specifically the <tt>write</tt> method) and send that to the function
    that outputs the data.
</dl>

Most of these things can be done without object orientation, but it is
object orientation that makes them easy.
</section>

<section title="Pike and object orientation">
In most object oriented languages there is a way to write functions outside
of all classes. Some readers might think this is what we have been doing
until now. However, in Pike, all functions have to reside within a program.
When you write a simple script in Pike, the file is first compiled into a
<b>program</b> then cloned and then main() is called in that clone. All
this is done by the <b>master object</b>, which is compiled and cloned before
before all other objects. What the <b>master object</b> actually does is:
<pre>
	program scriptclass=compile_file(argv[0]); // Load script
	object script=scriptclass();               // clone script
	int ret=script->main(sizeof(argv), argv);  // call main()
</pre>

Similarly, if you want to load another file and call functions in it, you
can do it with compile_file(), or you can use the cast operator and cast
the filename to a string. You can also use the module system, which we
will discuss further in the next chapter.
<p>
If you don't want to put each program in a separate file, you can use the
<tt>class</tt> keyword to write all your classes in one file. We have
already seen an example how this in chapter 4, but let's go over it in
more detail. The syntax looks like this:
<example language=pike meta=class_name,class_definition>
	class class_name {
	  class_definition
	}
</example>
This construction can be used almost anywhere within a normal program.
It can be used outside all functions, but it can also be used as an expression
in which case the defined class will be returned. In this case you may also
leave out the <i>class_name</i> and leave the class unnamed. The
<i>class definition</i> is simply the functions and programs you want to add
to the class.
<p>
To make it easier to program,
defining a class is also to define a
constant with that name. Essentially, these two lines of code do the same
thing:
<example language=pike>
	class foo {};
	constant foo = class {};
</example>
Because classes are defined as constants, it is possible to use a class defined
inside classes you define later, like this:
<example language=pike>
	class foo
	{
	  int test() { return 17; }
	};

	class bar
	{
	  program test2() { return foo; }
	};
</example>

</section>

<section title="Inherit">
A big part of writing object oriented code is the ability to add functionality
to a program without changing (or even understanding) the original code.
This is what <tt>inherit</tt> is all about.
Let's say I want to change the <tt>hello_world</tt> program to write a version number
before it writes hello world, using <tt>inherit</tt> I could do this like
this:
<example language=pike>
	inherit "hello_world";
	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  write("Hello world version 1.0\n");
	  return ::main(argc,argv);
	}
</example>
What inherit does is that it copies all the variables and functions from the
inherited program into the current one. You can then re-define any function
or variable you want, and you can call the original one by using a <tt>::</tt>
in front of the function name. The argument to inherit can be one of the following:
<dl>
<dt> A string
<dd> This will have the same effect as casting the string to a program and then
     doing inherit on this program.
<dt> A constant containing a program.
<dd> Any constant from this program, module or inherited program that contains a
     program can be inherited.
<dt> A class name
<dd> A class defined with the <tt>class</tt> keyword is in fact added as a constant,
     so the same rule as above applies.
</dl>
<p>

Let's look at an example. We'll split up an earlier example into three parts
and let each inherit the previous part. It would look something like this:
<center>
<image xfig=inherit><br>
</center>
Note that the actual code is not copied, only the list of references.
Also note that the list of inherits is copied when you inherit a program.
This does not mean you can access those copied inherits with the <tt>::</tt>
operator, it is merely an implementation detail. Although this example does
not show an example of a re-defined function, it should be easy to see how
that works by just changing what an identifier is pointing at.

</section>

<section title="Multiple inherit">
You can inherit any number of programs in one program, you can even inherit the
same thing more than once. If you do this you will get a separate set of functions
and variables for each inherit. To access a specific function you need to name
your inherits. Here is an example of named inherits:
<example language=pike>
	inherit Stdio.File;   // This inherit is named File
	inherit Stdio.FILE;   // This inherit is named FILE
	inherit "hello_word"; // This inherit is named hello_world
	inherit Stdio.File : test1; // This inherit is named test1
	inherit "hello_world" : test2; // This inherit is named test2

	void test()
	{
	  File::read(); // Read data from the first inherit
	  FILE::read(); // Read data from the second inherit
	  hello_world::main(0,({})); // Call main in the third inherit
	  test1::read(); // Read data from the fourth inherit
	  test2::main(0,({})); // Call main in the fifth inherit
	  ::read();  // Read data from all inherits
	}
</example>

As you can see it would be impossible to separate the different read and
main functions without using inherit names. If you tried calling
just <tt>read</tt> without any <tt>::</tt> or inherit name in front of it
Pike will call the last read defined, in this case it will call read in
the fourth inherit.
<p>
If you leave the inherit name blank and just call <tt>::read</tt> Pike will
call all inherited read() functions. If there is more than one inherited
read function the results will be returned in an array.
<p>
Let's look at another example:
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike
	
	inherit Stdio.File : input;
	inherit Stdio.File : output;
	
	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  output::create("stdout");
	  for(int e=1;e&lt;sizeof(argv);e++)
	  {
	    input::open(argv[e],"r");
            while(output::write(input::read(4096)) == 4096);
	  }
	}
</example>
This short piece of code works a lot like the UNIX command <tt>cat</tt>.
It reads all the files given on the command line and writes them to
stdout. As an example, I have inherited Stdio.File twice to show you
that both files are usable from my program.
</section>
<section title="Pike inherit compared to other languages">
Many other languages assign special meaning to inherit. Most common is the
notion that if you inherit a class, it means that your class should obey
the same rules as the inherited class. In Pike, this is not necessarily so.
You may wish to use inherit in Pike like this, but you can just as well
choose not to. This may confuse some programmers with previous experience
in object oriented programming.
</section>

<section title="Modifiers" name=modifiers>
Sometimes, you may wish to hide things from inheriting programs, or
prevent functions from being called from other objects. To do so you use
<b>modifiers</b>. A modifier is simply a word written before a variable
definition, function definition, class definition or an inherit that
specifies how this identifier should interact with other objects and programs.
These modifiers are available:
<dl>
<dt><tt>static</tt>
<dd>Static hides this identifier from the index and arrow operators, which
    makes it impossible for other objects to call this function unless a
    function pointer to it is returned from inside this program.
<dt><tt>final</tt>
<dd>This prevents other objects from re-defining this identifier in
    programs that inherit this program.
<dt><tt>local</tt>
<dd>This makes the identifier 'local' meaning that even if 
    it is overloaded in an inheriting program, this program will still
    use this identifer.
<dt><tt>private</tt>
<dd>This prevents inheriting programs from accessing this identifier.
    Note that inheriting program can still re-define the identifier.
    Also note that <tt>private</tt> does not imply <tt>static</tt>.
<dt><tt>public</tt>
<dd>This is the opposite of <tt>private</tt>. This is the default for
    all identifiers. <tt>public</tt> can be used to override the effects
    of a private inherit.
<dt><tt>protected</tt>
<dd>Reserved for future use.
</dl>
When modifiers are used in conjunction with inherit, all the variables,
functions and classes copied from the inherited class will be modified
with the keywords used. For instance, <tt>private inherit</tt> means that
the identifiers from this inherit will not be available to program inheriting
this program. <tt>static private inherit</tt> will also hide those identifiers
from the index and arrow operators, making the inherit available only to the
code in this program.
</section>

<section title="Operator overloading">
Sometimes you want an object to act as if it was a string, an integer or some
other data type. It is especially interesting to be able to use the normal
operators on objects to allow short and readable syntax. In Pike, special
methods are called when an operator is used with an object. To some extent,
this is work in progress, but what has been done so far is very useful and
will not be subject to change.
<p>
The following table assumes that a and b are objects and shows what will be
evaluated if you use that particular operation on an object. Note that some
of these operators, notably <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!</tt> have default behavior
which will be used if the corresponding method is not defined in the object.
Other operators will simply fail if called with objects. Refer to
<ref to=operators> for information on which operators can operate on objects
without operator overloading.
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Will call</th><th>Or</th></tr>
<tr><td>a+b</td><td>a-&gt;`+(b)</td><td>b-&gt;``+(a)</td></tr>

<p>

Here is a really silly example of a program that will write 10
to stdout when executed.

<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike
	class three {
	  int `+(int foo) { return 3+foo; }
	};

	int main()
	{
	  write(sprintf("%d\n",three()+7));
	}
</example>

It is important to know that some optimizations are still performed even
when operator overloading is in effect. If you define a multiplication operator
and multiply your object with one, you should not be surprised if the
multiplication operator is never called. This might not always be what you
expect, in which case you are better off not using operator overloading.

<chapter title="Miscellaneous functions" name=misc>

There are some 'functions' in Pike that are not really functions at all but
just as builtin as operators. These special functions can do things that no
other functions can do, but they can not be re-defined or overloaded.
In this chapter I will describe these functions and why they are implemented
as special functions.

<anchor name=sscanf>
<section title="sscanf">
Sscanf may look exactly like a normal function, but normal functions
can not set the variables you send to it. The purpose of sscanf is to
match one string against a format string and place the matching results
into a list of variables. The syntax looks like this:
<example language=pike meta=str,fmt,lvalue>
	int sscanf(string str, string fmt, lvalue ...)
</example>
The string <i>str</i> will be matched against the format string <i>fmt</i>.
<i>fmt</i> can contain strings
separated by %d,%s,%c and %f. Every % corresponds to one <i>lvalue</i>.
An lvalue is the name of a variable, a name of a local variable, an index
in an array, mapping or object. It is because of these lvalues that sscanf
can not be implemented as a normal function.
<p>
Whenever a percent is found in the format string, a match is according
to the following table:
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr valign=top><td> %d </td><td> reads an integer </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %o </td><td> reads an octal integer </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %x </td><td> reads a hexadecimal integer </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %D </td><td> reads an integer that is either octal (leading zero), hexadecimal (leading 0x) or decimal. </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %f </td><td> reads a float </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %c </td><td> matches one char and returns it as an integer </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %2c </td><td> matches two chars and returns them as an integer (short) </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %4F </td><td> matches four chars and returns them as a float (IEEE single precision) </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %8F </td><td> matches eigth chars and returns them as a float (IEEE double precision) </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %s </td><td> reads a string. If followed by %d, %s will
 read any non-numerical characters. If followed by a %[], %s will read any
 characters not present in the set. If followed by normal text, %s will match
 all characters up to but not including the first occurrence of that text. </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %5s </td><td> gives a string of 5 characters (5 can be any number) </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %[set] </td><td> matches a string containing a given set of characters (those given inside the brackets). %[^set] means any character except those inside brackets. Example: %[0-9H] means any number or 'H'. </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> %{format%} </td><td> Repeatedly matches 'format' as many times as possible and assigns an array of arrays with the results to the lvalue. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>If a * is put between the percent and the operator, the operator
will only match its argument, not assign any variables.
<p>
Sscanf does not use backtracking. Sscanf simply looks at the format string
up to the next % and tries to match that with the string. It then proceeds
to look at the next part. If a part does not match, sscanf immediately
returns how many % were matched. If this happens, the lvalues for % that
were not matched will not be changed.
<p>
Let's look at a couple of examples:
<example language=pike>
	// a will be assigned "oo" and 1 will be returned
	sscanf("foo","f%s",a);

	// a will be 4711 and b will be "bar", 2 will be returned
	sscanf("4711bar","%d%s",a,b);

	// a will become "test"
	sscanf(" \t test","%*[ \t]%s",a)

	// Remove "the " from the beginning of a string
	// If 'str' does not begin with "the " it will not be changed
	sscanf(str,"the %s",str);
</example>

<anchor name=catch>
<anchor name=exceptions>
<section title="catch & throw">
Catch is used to trap errors and other exceptions in Pike.
It works by making a block of code into an expression, like this:
<example language=pike meta=statements>
	catch { statements }
</example>
If an error occurs, catch will return a description of the error.
The description of the error has the following format:
<example language=pike>
	({
	   "error description",
	   backtrace()
	})
</example>
If no error occurs, catch will return zero. You may emulate your own errors
using the function throw, described in <ref to=functions>.
<p>
Example:
<example language=pike>
	int x,y;
	// This might generate "division by zero"
	mixed error=catch { x/=y; };
</example>
</section>
</anchor>
</anchor>

<anchor name=gauge>
<section title="gauge">
The syntax for gauge is the same as the syntax for catch:
<example language=pike meta=statements>
	gauge { statements }
</example>
However, gauge simply returns how many milliseconds the code took to execute.
This can be used to find out how fast your code actually is.. :)
Only CPU time used by the Pike process is measured. This means that if it takes
two seconds to execute but only uses 50% CPU, this function will return 1000.
</section>
</anchor>

<anchor name=typeof>
<section title="typeof">
This function returns the type of an expression as a string. It does not
evaluate the expression at all, which might be somewhat confusing. Example:
<example language=pike>
	typeof( exit(1) )
</example>
This will return the string <tt>"void"</tt> since exit is a function that
returns void.
It will not execute the function <tt>exit</tt> and exit the process as you
might expect.

<chapter title="Modules" name=modules>

A module is a software package that plugs into the Pike programming
environment. They provide you with simple interfaces to system routines
and they also constitute a neat way to use your own C/C++ code from
within Pike. Pike comes with a number of modules that are ready to use.
In this chapter I will explain the basics of modules and how to use them.
<p>
here is a list of the basic Pike modules:
<dl>
<dt>Stdio
<dd>This module contains file I/O routines.

</dl>
<p>
* These modules might not be available depending on how Pike was compiled
  and whether support for these functions exist on your system.<br>
<p>

<section title="How to use modules">
A module is a bunch of functions, programs or other modules collected in
one symbol. For instance, the module <tt>Stdio</tt> contains the objects
<tt>stdin</tt>, <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt>. To access these objects
you can write <tt>Stdio.stdin</tt>, <tt>Stdio.stdout</tt> or
<tt>Stdio.stderr</tt> anywhere in your program where an object of that type
is acceptable. If you use <tt>Stdio</tt> a lot you can put
<tt>import Stdio;</tt> in the beginning of your program. This will import
all the identifiers from the module Stdio into your program, making it
possible to write just <tt>stdin</tt> instead of <tt>Stdio.stdin</tt>.
</section>

<section title="Where do modules come from?">
Modules are not loaded until you use them, which saves memory unless you use
all the modules. However, if you want to write your own modules it is important
to know how modules are located and loaded.
<p>
When you use <tt>Stdio</tt> Pike will look for that module:
<ol>
<li> In imported directories.
<li> In directories added with add_module_path()
<li> In directories specified with -M on the command line.
<li> In directories in the environment variable PIKE_MODULE_PATH
<li> In the directory with builtin modules, usually /usr/local/lib/pike/modules/
</ol>

For each of these directories, Pike will do the following:
<ol>
<li> If there is a file called Stdio.pmod.pike, Pike will load this
     Pike program, clone it and use that as a module.
<li> If there is a file called Stdio.pmod.so, Pike will load this
     with load_module(), clone it and use that as a module.
<li> If there is a directory called Stdio.pmod, Pike will create a module
     containing all the modules in that directory as identifiers. If there is
     a module called <tt>module</tt> in that directory, all identifiers
     from that module will overload any modules actually present in the
     directory.
</ol>


As you can see, quite a lot of work goes into finding the modules, this
makes it possible to choose the most convenient way to build your own Pike
modules.
</section>

<section title="The . operator">
The period operator is not really an operator, as it is always evaluated
during the compilation. It works similarly to the index and arrow operators,
but can only be used on constant values such as modules. In most cases,
modules are simply a clone of a program, in which case the identifiers in
the module will be the same as those in the program. But some modules,
like those created from directories, overload the index operator so that
the identifiers in the module can be something other than those in the program.
For directory modules, the index operator looks in the directory it was
cloned for to find the identifiers.
</section>

<section title="How to write a module">
Here is an example of a simple module:
<example language=pike>
	constant PI = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510;
	float cos2(float f) { return pow(cos(f),2.0); }
</example>
if we save this short file as <tt>Trig.pmod</tt> we can now use this
module like this:
<example language=pike>
	int main()
	{
	  write(sprintf("%f\n",Trig.cos2(Trig.PI));
	}
</example>
or like this:
<example language=pike>
	import Trig;

	int main() 
	{
	  write(sprintf("%f\n",cos2(PI));
	}
</example>
</section>

<section title="Simple exercises">
<box>
<ul>
<li> Save the hello_world.pike program as hello_world.pike.pmod, then make
     a program that loads this module and calls its main().
<li> Make a directory called <tt>Programs.pmod</tt> and put all the examples you
     have written so far in it. Make a program that runs one of those
     programs. Make sure the program can be modified to run another of
     your examples by changing what module it loads.
<li> Copy the file hello_world.pike.pmod to programs/module.pike.pmod and
     then write a program that runs hello_world without actually using the
     identifier <tt>hello_world</tt>.
<li> Try putting <tt>Programs.pmod</tt> in another directory and then try to
     run the programs from the last two examples. 
</ul>

Programming without reading and writing data from files, sockets, keyboard
etc. would be quite pointless. Luckily enough, Pike provides you with an
object oriented interface to files, pipes and TCP sockets. All I/O functions
and classes are collected in the module <tt>Stdio</tt>.

<class name=File>
<section title="Stdio.File">
This is the basic I/O object, it provides socket communication as well
as file access. It does not buffer reads and writes or provide line-by-line
reading, that is done in the FILE object. <tt>Stdio.File</tt> is completely
written in C. What follows is a description of all the functions in
<tt>Stdio.File</tt>.

<method name=create title="init file struct">
<man_syntax>
object(Stdio.File) Stdio.File();<br>
object(Stdio.File) Stdio.File(string <I>fd</I>);<br>
object(Stdio.File) Stdio.File(string <i>file</i>, string <i>mode</i>);<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
There are three different ways to clone a File.
The first is to clone it without any arguments, in which case the you
have to call open(), connect() or some other method which connects
the File object with a stream.
<p>
However, instead of cloning and then calling open(), you can clone
the File with a filename and open mode. This is the same thing as
cloning and then calling open, except shorter and faster.
<p>
Alternatively, you can clone a File with "stdin", "stdout" or
"stderr" as argument. This will open the specified standard
stream.
</man_description>
<man_see>clone, Stdio.File-&gt;open</man_see>
</method>

<method name=open title="open a file">
<man_syntax>
int open(string <I>filename</I>, string <I>how</I>);<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
Open a file for read, write or append. The variable <i>how</i> should
contain one or more of the following letters:
<p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr valign=top><td> 'r' </td><td> open file for reading </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> 'w' </td><td> open file for writing </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> 'a' </td><td> open file for append (use with 'w') </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> 't' </td><td> truncate file at open (use with 'w') </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> 'c' </td><td> create file if it doesn't exist (use with 'w') </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> 'x' </td><td> fail if file already exist (use with 'c') </td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>How</i> should _always_ contain at least one of 'r' or 'w'.
<p>Returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise.

<man_see>Stdio.File-&gt;close</man_see>
</method>


<method name=close title="close a file">
<man_syntax>
int close(string <I>how</I>);<br>
int close();<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
Close the file. Optionally, specify "r", "w" or "rw" to close just
the read, just the write or both read and write part of the file
respectively. Note that this function will not call the
close_callback.

<method name=read title="read data from a file or stream">
<man_syntax>
string read(int <I>nbytes</I>);<br>
string read(int <I>nbytes</I>, int <I>notall</I>);<br>
string read();<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
Read tries to read <i>nbytes</i> bytes from the file, and return it as a
string. If something goes wrong, zero is returned.
<p>If a one is given as second argument to read(), read will not try
its best to read as many bytes as you asked it to read, it will
merely try to read as many bytes as the system read function will
return. This mainly useful with stream devices which can return
exactly one row or packet at a time.
<p>
If no arguments are given, read will read to the end of the file/stream.

string read_oob(int <I>nbytes</I>, int <I>notall</I>);<br>
string read_oob();<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
Tries to read <i>nbytes</i> bytes of out-of-band data from the stream,
and returns it as a string. If something goes wrong, zero is returned.
<p>
If a one is given as a second argument to <tt>read_oob()</tt>, only
as many bytes of out-of-band data as is currently available will be
returned.
<p>
If no arguments are given, <tt>read_oob</tt> will read to the end of
the stream.

void set_buffer(int <I>bufsize</I>, string <I>mode</I>);<br>
void set_buffer(int <I>bufsize</I>);<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function sets the internal buffer size of a socket or stream.
The second argument allows you to set the read or write buffer by
specifying "r" or "w". It is not guaranteed that this function
actually does anything, but it certainly helps to increase data
transfer speed when it does.

<man_description>
This function sets a stream to nonblocking mode. When data arrives on
the stream, read_callback will be called with some or all of this data.
When the stream has buffer space over for writing, write_callback is
called so you can write more data to it. If the stream is closed at
the other end, close_callback is called. All callbacks will have the
id of file as first argument when called.
<p>
If no arguments are given, the callbacks are not changed. The
stream is just set to nonblocking mode.

<man_description>
This function works similarly to Stdio.File-&gt;assign, but instead of making
the argument a reference to the same file, it creates a new file
with the same properties and places it in the argument.

This makes this file into a socket ready for connection. The reason
for this function is so that you can set the socket to nonblocking
or blocking (default is blocking) before you call Stdio.File-&gt;connect()
This function returns 1 for success, 0 otherwise.
<p>
If you give a port number to this function, the socket will be bound to
this port locally before connecting anywhere. This is only useful for
some silly protocols like FTP. You may also specify an address to bind to
if your machine has many IP numbers.

</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function connects a socket previously created with
Stdio.File-&gt;open_socket to a remote socket. The argument is the IP name
or number for he remote machine.
<p>This function returns 1 for success, 0 otherwise. Note that if the
socket is in nonblocking mode, you have to wait for a write or close

</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function creates a pipe between the object it was called in
and an object that is returned. The two ends of the pipe are
indistinguishable. If the File object this function is called in
was open to begin with, it is closed before the pipe is created.

<!-- FIX ME might be good to have a plain and simple example of Stdio.File here -->

<p>
Here is an example of how to use the TCP functions in Stdio.File in blocking
mode. This short program takes a URL as first argument, connects to the
WWW server, sends a HEAD request and writes the reply to stdout. For clarity,
all calls to Stdio.File use <tt>File::</tt> even if that is not strictly
necessary.

<example language=pike>
	import Stdio;
	inherit File;

	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  string host;
	  string path="";
	  int port=80;
	  sscanf(argv[1],"http://%s",argv[1]);
	  sscanf(argv[1],"%s/%s",host,path);
	  sscanf(host,"%s:%d",host,port);

	  if(!File::open_socket())
	  {
	    perror("Open socket failed");
	    exit(1);
	  }

	  if(!File::connect(host,port))
	  {
	    perror("Failed to connect to remote host");
	    exit(1);
	  }

	  File::write(sprintf("HEAD /%s HTTP/1.0\n",path));

</class>


<anchor name=Stdio.stdin>

<anchor name=Stdio.stderr>
<section title="Standard streams">
Any UNIX program has three files open from the beginning. These are called
standard input, standard output and standard error stream. These streams
are available from Pike as well. They are called <tt>Stdio.stdin</tt>,
<tt>Stdio.stdout</tt> and <tt>Stdio.stderr</tt> respectively. Standard
input is a clone of <tt>Stdio.FILE</tt>, which means you can use the line
oriented functions. <tt>Stdio.stdout</tt> and <tt>Stdio.stderr</tt> are
simply clones of <tt>Stdio.File</tt>.
<p>
Example:
<example language=pike>
	int main()
	{
	  int line;
	  while(string s=Stdio.stdin.gets())
	    write(sprintf("%5d: %s\n",line++,s));
	}
</example>
This example will read lines from standard input for as long as there
are more lines to read. Each line will then be written to stdout together
with the line number. We could use <tt>Stdio.stdout.write</tt> instead
of just <tt>write</tt> because they are the same function.

<section title="A more complex example - a simple WWW server">

As most of you know, WWW  WWW (World Wide Web), works by using a
client program which will fetch files from remote servers when asked.
Usually by clicking a picture or text. This example is a program for the
server which will send files to any computer that requests them. The
protocol used to send the file is called HTTP. (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol)
<p>
Usually WWW involves HTML. HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) is a way to
write documents with embedded pictures and links to other pages. These
links are normally displayed underlined and if you click them your WWW-
browser will load whatever document that link leads to.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike
	
	/* A very small httpd capable of fetching files only.
	 * Written by Fredrik Hübinette as a demonstration of Pike.
	 */
	
	inherit Stdio.Port;
</example>
We inherit Stdio.Port into this program so we can bind a TCP socket to accept
incoming connection.  A socket is simply a number to separate communications
to and from different programs on the same computer.
<p>
Next are some constants that will affect how uHTTPD will operate. This uses
the preprocessor directive #define. The preprocessor is the first stage in
the compiling process and can make textual processing of the code before
it is compiled. As an example, after the first define below, all occurrences
of 'BLOCK' will be replaced with 16060.
<example language=pike>
	
	/* Amount of data moved in one operation */
	#define BLOCK 16060
	
	/* Where do we have the html files ? */
	#define BASE "/usr/local/html/"
	
	/* File to return when we can't find the file requested */
	#define NOFILE "/user/local/html/nofile.html"
	
	/* Port to open */
	#define PORT 1905
</example>
A port is a destination for a TCP connection. It is simply a number on the
local computer. 1905 is not the standard port for HTTP connections though,
which means that if you want to access this WWW server from a browser you
need to specify the port like this: http://my.host.my.domain:1905/
<p>
Next we declare a class called output_class. Later we will clone one
instance of this class for each incoming HTTP connection.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	class output_class
	{
	  inherit Stdio.File : socket;
	  inherit Stdio.File : file;
</example>
Our new class inherits Stdio.File twice. To be able to separate them
they are then named 'socket' and 'file'.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  int offset=0;
</example>
Then there is a global variable called offset which is initialized to zero.
(Each instance of this class will have its own instance of this variable,
 so it is not truly global, but...) 
Note that the initialization is done when the class is cloned (or
instantiated if you prefer C++ terminology).
<p>
Next we define the function write_callback(). Later the program will go
into a 'waiting' state, until something is received to process, or until
there is buffer space available to write output to. When that happens a
callback will be called to do this. The write_callback() is called when
there is buffer space available. In the following lines 'void' means that
it does not return a value. Write callback will be used further down as a
callback and will be called whenever there is room in the socket output
buffer.
<example language=pike>
	
	  void write_callback()
	  {
	    int written;
	    string data;
</example>
The following line means: call seek in the inherited program 'file'.
<example language=pike>
	
	    file::seek(offset);
</example>
Move the file pointer to the where we want to the position we want to read
from. The file pointer is simply a location in the file, usually it is where
the last read() ended and the next will begin. seek() can move this pointer
to where we want it though.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	    data=file::read(BLOCK);
</example>
Read BLOCK (16060) bytes from the file. If there are less that that left to
read only that many bytes will be returned.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	    if(strlen(data))
	    {
</example>
 If we managed to read something...
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      written=socket::write(data);
</example>
 ... we try to write it to the socket.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      if(written &gt;= 0)
	      {
		offset+=written;
		return;
	      }
</example>
 Update offset if we managed to write to the socket without errors.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      werror("Error: "+socket::errno()+".\n");
	    }
</example>
 If something went wrong during writing, or there was nothing left to read
 we destruct this instance of this class.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	    destruct(this_object());
	  }
</example>
 That was the end of write_callback()
<p>

 Next we need a variable to buffer the input received in. We initialize it
 to an empty string.
<example language=pike>
	
	  string input="";
</example>
 And then we define the function that will be called when there is something
 in the socket input buffer. The first argument 'id' is declared as mixed,
 which means that it can contain any type of value. The second argument is
 the contents of the input buffer.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  void read_callback(mixed id,string data)
	  {
	    string cmd;
	
	    input+=data;
</example>
Append data to the string input. Then we check if we have received a
a complete line yet. If so we parse this and start outputting the file.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	    if(sscanf(input,"%s %s%*[\012\015 \t]",cmd,input)&gt;2)
	    {
</example>
This sscanf is pretty complicated, but in essence it means: put the
first word in 'input' in 'cmd' and the second in 'input' and return 2
if successful, 0 otherwise.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      if(cmd!="GET")
	      {
		werror("Only method GET is supported.\n");
		destruct(this_object());
		return;
	      }
</example>
If the first word isn't GET print an error message and terminate
this instance of the program. (and thus the connection)
<example language=pike>
	
	      sscanf(input,"%*[/]%s",input);
</example>
Remove the leading slash.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      input=BASE+combine_path("/",input);
</example>
Combine the requested file with the base of the HTML tree, this gives
us a full filename beginning with a slash. The HTML tree is the
directory on the server in which the HTML files are located. Normally
all files in this directory can be accessed by anybody by using a WWW
browser. So if a user requests 'index.html' then that file name is first
added to BASE (/home/hubbe/www/html/ in this case) and if that file exists
it will be returned to the browser.
<example language=pike>
	      
	      if(!file::open(input,"r"))
	      {
</example>
Try opening the file in read-only mode. If this fails, try opening NOFILE
instead. Opening the file will enable us to read it later.
<p>
<example language=pike>
		if(!file::open(NOFILE,"r"))
		{
</example>
If this fails too. Write an error message and destruct this object.
<p>
<example language=pike>
		  werror("Couldn't find default file.\n");
		  destruct(this_object());
		  return;
		}
	      }
</example>
Ok, now we set up the socket so we can write the data back.
<example language=pike>
	
	      socket::set_buffer(65536,"w");
</example>
Set the buffer size to 64 kilobytes.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      socket::set_nonblocking(0,write_callback,0);
</example>
Make it so that write_callback is called when it is time to write more
data to the socket.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	      write_callback();
</example>
Jump-start the writing.
<example language=pike>
	    }
	  }
</example>
That was the end of read_callback().
<p>

This function is called if the connection is closed while we are reading
from the socket.
<example language=pike>
	  void selfdestruct() { destruct(this_object()); }

</example>
This function is called when the program is instantiated. It is used
to set up data the way we want it. Extra arguments to clone() will be
sent to this function. In this case it is the object representing the
new connection.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  void create(object f)
	  {
	    socket::assign(f);
</example>
We insert the data from the file f into 'socket'.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	    socket::set_nonblocking(read_callback,0,selfdestruct);
</example>
Then we set up the callback functions and sets the file nonblocking.
Nonblocking mode means that read() and write() will rather return that
wait for I/O to finish. Then we sit back and wait for read_callback to
be called.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  }
</example>
End of create()
<p>
<example language=pike>
	};
</example>
End of the new class.
<p>
Next we define the function called when someone connects.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	void accept_callback()
	{
	  object tmp_output;
</example>
This creates a local variable of type 'object'. An object variable can
contain a clone of any program. Pike does not consider clones of different
programs different types. This also means that function calls to objects
have to be resolved at run time.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  tmp_output=accept();
</example>
The function accept  clones a Stdio.File and makes this equal to the
newly connected socket.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  if(!tmp_output) return;
</example>
If it failed we just return.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  output_class(tmp_output);
</example>
Otherwise we clone an instance of 'output_class' and let it take care of the
connection. Each clone of output_class will have its own set of global
variables, which will enable many connections to be active at the same
time without data being mixed up. Note that the programs will not actually
run simultaneously though.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	  destruct(tmp_output);
</example>
Destruct the object returned by accept(), output_class has already copied
the contents of this object.
<p>
<example language=pike>
	}

</example>
Then there is main, the function that gets it all started.
	
<example language=pike>
	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  werror("Starting minimal httpd\n");
</example>
Write an encouraging message to stderr.
<example language=pike>
	
	  if(!bind(PORT, accept_callback))
	  {
	    werror("Failed to open socket (already bound?)\n");
	    return 17;
	  }

</example>
Bind PORT and set it up to call accept_callback as soon as someone connects
to it. If the bind() fails we write an error message and return the 17 to
indicate failure.
<example language=pike>
	
	  return - 17; /* Keep going */
</example>
If everything went ok, we return -17, any negative value returned by main()
means that the program WON'T exit, it will hang around waiting for events
instead. (like someone connecting)
<example language=pike>
	}
</example>
That's it, this simple program can be used as the basis for a simple
WWW-server. Note that today most WWW servers are very complicated programs,
and the above program can never replace a modern WWW server.
However, it is very fast if you only want a couple of web pages and have
a slow machine available for the server.

<module name=Thread>
<chapter title="Threads">
Threads are used to run several Pike functions at the same time without having to start
several Pike processes. Using threads often simplifies coding and because the
threads are within the same process, data can be shared or sent to other threads
very fast. Threads are not supported on all systems, you may test if you have
thread support with the preprocessor construction <tt>#if constant(thread_create)</tt>.
Pike needs POSIX or UNIX thread support when compiled to support threads.
<p>

<section title="Starting a thread">
Starting a thread is very easy. You simply call <tt>thread_create</tt> with a function
pointer and any arguments it needs and that function will be executed in a
separate thread. The function <tt>thread_create</tt> will return immediately and both
the calling function and the called function will execute at the same time. Example:
<example language=pike>
	void foo(int x)
	{
	  for(int e=0;e&lt;5;e++)
	  {
	    sleep(1);
	    write("Hello from thread "+x+".\n");
	  }
	}

	int main()
	{
	  thread_create(foo, 2);
	  thread_create(foo, 3);
	  foo(1);
	}
</example>
This may all seem very simple, but there are a few complications to
watch out for:
<dl>
<dt> Accessing unlocked data
<dd> Look at this code:
<example language=pike>
	void mapadd(mapping m, int i, int j)
	{
	  if(map[i])
	     map[i]+=({j});
	  else
	     map[i]=({j});
	}
</example>
This is quite harmless as long as it is only used from one thread at a time,
but if two threads call it it at the same time, there is a slight chance that
both threads will discover that <tt>map[i]</tt> is zero and both threads will
then do <tt>map[i]=({j});</tt> and one value of <tt>j</tt> will be lost.
This type of bug can be extremely hard to debug.

The above problem can be solved with the help of Mutexes and Condition
variables. Mutexes are basically a way to keep other threads out while a task
is being performed. Conditions, or <b>condition variables</b>, are used to inform
other threads that they don't have to wait any longer. Pike also provides
two different kinds of pipelines to send data from one thread to another, which
makes it very simple to write threaded programs. Let's look at an example:
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike
	import Thread;			// We need fifos
	inherit Fifo;			// Fifo used to supply workers
	inherit Fifo : ended;		// Fifo used to wait for workers

	void worker(string lookfor)
	{
	  while(string file=Fifo::read())
	  {
	    int linenum=1;
	    object o=Stdio.FILE(file,"r");
	    while(string line=o-&gt;gets())
	    {
	      if(search(line, lookfor) &gt;=0)
		write(sprintf("%s:%d: %s\n",file, linenum, line));

	      linenum++;
	    }
	  }
	  ended::write(0);
	}

	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  for(int e=0;e&lt;4;e++)          // Start workers
	    thread_create(worker,argv[e]);
	  for(int e=2;e&lt;argc;e++)       // Feed workers
	    Fifo::write(argv[1]);
	  for(int e=0;e&lt;4;e++)          // Tell workers to die
	    Fifo::write(0);
	  for(int e=0;e&lt;4;e++)          // Wait for workers to die
	     ended::read();
	  exit(0);
	}
</example>

This is an example of a simple grep-like program. It looks for the string
given as first argument to the program in the files given as the rest
of the arguments. Don't worry if you do not understand it yet. Read the
descriptions of the functions and classes below and come back and read
this example again.

<dt> Deadlocks
<dd> Deadlocks arise when two threads are waiting for each other to do something.
     This bug can often arise when several threads need access to a number of
     resources such as files or other I/O devices. What may happen is that one
     thread has locked device #1 and is trying to lock device #2 while another
     thread has locked device #2 and is trying to lock device #1. This type
     of bug is generally easier to find, but may require a lot of work to fix.

<man_description>
Thread.Mutex is a pre-compiled Pike program that implements
mutual exclusion locks. Mutex locks are used to prevent multiple
threads from simultaneously execute sections of code which access

the thread will sleep until the mutex is unlocked.

<section title="Threads example">
Let's look at an example of how to work with threads. This program is the same
minimal WWW server as in <ref to=io> but it has been
re-written to use threads, as you can see it is a lot smaller this
way. This is because we can use blocking I/O operations instead of
non-blocking and callbacks. This also makes the program much easier to
follow:
<example language=pike>
#!/usr/local/bin/pike

/* A very small threaded httpd capable of fetching files only.
 * Written by Fredrik Hübinette as a demonstration of Pike
 */

import Thread;
inherit Stdio.Port;

/* number of bytes to read for each write */

/* Where do we have the html files ? */
#define BASE "/home/hubbe/pike/src/"

/* File to return when we can't find the file requested */
#define NOFILE "/home/hubbe/www/html/nofile.html"

/* Port to open */
#define PORT 1905

/* Number of threads to start */
#define THREADS 5

// There will be one of these for each thread
class worker
{
  inherit Stdio.FILE : socket;  // For communication with the browser
  inherit Stdio.File : file;    // For reading the file from disc

  void create(function accept)
  {
    string cmd, input, tmp;

    while(1)
    {
      socket::close();    // Close previous connection
      file::close();

      object o=accept();  // Accept a connection
      if(!o) continue;
      socket::assign(o);
      destruct(o);

      // Read request
      sscanf(socket::gets(),"%s %s%*[\012\015 \t]",cmd, input);
      if(cmd!="GET")
      {
	werror("Only method GET is supported.\n");
	continue;
      }

      // Open the requested file      
      sscanf(input,"%*[/]%s",input);
      input=BASE+combine_path("/",input);
      
      if(!file::open(input,"r"))
      {
	if(!file::open(NOFILE,"r"))
	{
	  werror("Couldn't find default file.\n");
	  continue;
	}
      }

      // Copy data to socket
      while(socket::write(file::read(BLOCK))==BLOCK);
    }
  }
};

int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
{
  werror("Starting minimal threaded httpd\n");

  // Bind the port, don't set it nonblocking
  if(!bind(PORT))
  {
    werror("Failed to open socket (already bound?)\n");
    return 17;
  }

  // Start worker threads
  for(int e=1;e&lt;THREADS;e++) thread_create(worker,accept);
  worker(accept);

on some UNIX systems. The above example does not work if your system does

<chapter title="Modules for specific data types">

There are a few modules that provide extra functions that operate specifically
on one data type. These modules have the same name as the data type, but are
capitalized so you can tell the difference. At the time of writing, the only
such modules are <tt>String</tt> and <tt>Array</tt>, but more are expected to
show up in the future.

<section title="String">
<module name="String" title="extra string functionality module">
The module <tt>String</tt> contains some extra string functionality which
is not always used. These functions are mostly implemented in Pike as a
complement to those written in C.

<anchor name=Image>
<chapter title=Image>
The Image module is used to manipulate bit-mapped color images. 
It can read PPM images and do various manipulations, or it can be
used to create completely new images. The created images can be
saved as PPM or converted to GIF.
<p>
All images handled by this module are stored as 24-bit RGB images.
This means that a 1024 pixel wide and 1024 pixel high image will
use 1024*1024*3 bytes = 3 megabytes. It is quite easy to mess up
and use up all the memory by giving the wrong argument to one
of the scaling functions.
<p>
Most functions in this module work by creating a new Image and then
returning that instead of changing the Image you are working with.
This makes it possible to share the same image between many variables
without having to worry that it will be changed by accident. This
can reduce the amount of memory used.
<p>
Many functions in this module work with the 'current color', this can
be thought of as the background color if you wish. To change the
current color you use 'setcolor'.
<p>

Let's look at an example of how this can be used:
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike

	int main()
	{
	  write("Content-type: image/gif\n\n");
	  object font=Image.font();
	  font-&gt;load("testfont");
	  object image=font-&gt;write(ctime(time));
	  write(Image.GIF.encode(image));
	}
</example>
This very simple example can be used as a CGI script to produce a gif image
which says what time it is in white text on a black background.

The system module contains some system-specific functions that may or may
not be available on your system. Most of these functions do exactly the same
thing as their UNIX counterpart. See the UNIX man pages for detailed

<module name=Regexp>
<section title="Regexp">
Regexp is short for <b>Regular Expression</b>. A regular expression is
a standardized way to make pattern that match certain strings. In Pike
you can often use the sscanf, range and index operators to match strings,
but sometimes a regexp is both faster and easier.
<p>
A regular expression is actually a string, then compiled into an object.
The string contains characters that make up a pattern for other strings
to match. Normal characters, such as A through Z only match themselves,
but some characters have special meaning. 

<table>
<tr><th> pattern </th><th>Matches</th></tr>
<tr><td> . </td><td> any one character </td></tr>
<tr><td> [abc] </td><td> a, b or c </td></tr>
<tr><td> [a-z] </td><td> any character a to z inclusive </td></tr>
<tr><td> [^ac] </td><td> any character except a and c </td></tr>
<tr><td> (x) </td><td> x (x might be any regexp) If used with split, this also puts the string matching x into the result array. </td></tr>
<tr><td> x* </td><td> zero or more occurrences of 'x' (x may be any regexp) </td></tr>
<tr><td> x+ </td><td> one or more occurrences of 'x' (x may be any regexp) </td></tr>
<tr><td> x|y </td><td> x or y. (x or y may be any regexp) </td></tr>
<tr><td> xy </td><td> xy (x and y may be any regexp) </td></tr>
<tr><td> ^ </td><td> beginning of string (but no characters) </td></tr>
<tr><td> $ </td><td> end of string (but no characters) </td></tr>
<tr><td> \&lt; </td><td> the beginning of a word (but no characters) </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> \&gt; </td><td> the end of a word (but no characters) </td></tr>
</table>
Let's look at a few examples:
<table>
<tr><th>Regexp</th><th>Matches</th></tr>
<tr><td>[0-9]+</td><td>one or more digits</td></tr>
<tr><td>[^ \t\n]</td><td>exactly one non-whitespace character</td></tr>
<tr><td>(foo)|(bar)</td><td>either 'foo' or 'bar'</td></tr>
<tr><td>\.html$</td><td>any string ending in '.html'</td></tr>
<tr><td>^\.</td><td>any string starting with a period</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that \ can be used to quote these characters in which case
they match themselves, nothing else. Also note that when quoting
these something in Pike you need two \ because Pike also uses
this character for quoting.
<p>
To make make regexps fast, they are compiled in a similar way that Pike is,
they can then be used over and over again without needing to be recompiled.
To give the user full control over the compilations and use of regexp an
object oriented interface is provided.
<p>
You might wonder what regexps are good for, hopefully it should be more clear
when you read about the following functions:

</man_syntax>
<man_description>
When create is called, the current regexp bound to this object is
cleared. If a string is sent to create(), this string will be compiled
to an internal representation of the regexp and bound to this object
for later calls to match or split. Calling create() without an
argument can be used to free up a little memory after the regexp has
been used.

The Gmp library can handle large integers, floats and rational numbers, but

<man_description>
Without arguments, this function does nothing. With one argument it
opens the given file as a gdbm database, if this fails for some
reason, an error will be generated. If a second argument is present,
it specifies how to open the database using one or more of the follow
flags in a string:
<p><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr valign=top><td> r </td><td> open database for reading </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> w </td><td> open database for writing </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> c </td><td> create database if it does not exist </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> t </td><td> overwrite existing database </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> f </td><td> fast mode </td></tr>
</table>

<p>The fast mode prevents the database from synchronizing each change
in the database immediately. This is dangerous because the database
can be left in an unusable state if Pike is terminated abnormally.
<p>The default mode is "rwc".

<module name=Getopt>
<section title="Getopt">
Getopt is a group of function which can be used to find command line options.
Command line options come in two flavors: long and short. The short ones
consists of a dash followed by a character (<tt>-t</tt>), the long ones
consist of two dashes followed by a string of text (<tt>--test</tt>).
The short options can also be combined, which means that you can write
<tt>-tda</tt> instead of <tt>-t -d -a</tt>. Options can also require
arguments, in which case they cannot be combined. To write an option
with an argument you write <tt>-t <i>argument</i></tt> or <tt>-t<i>argument</i></tt> or <tt>--test=<i>argument</i></tt>.

<hr noshade size=1>
<function name=Getopt.find_option title="find command line options">
<man_syntax>
<p>mixed find_option(array(string) <i>argv</i>,<br>
<dl><dt><dd>string <i>shortform</i>,<br>
void|string <i>longform</i>,<br>
void|string <i>envvar</i>,<br>
void|mixed <i>def</i>,<br>
void|int <i>throw_errors</i>);<br>
</dl>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This is a generic function to parse command line options of the
type '-f', '--foo' or '--foo=bar'. The first argument should be
the array of strings that is sent as second argument to your
main() function, the second is a string with the short form of
your option. The short form must be only one character long.
The 'longform' is an alternative and maybe more readable way to
give the same option. If you give "foo" as longform your program
will accept '--foo' as argument. The envvar argument specifies what
environment variable can be used to specify the same option. The
envvar option exists to make it easier to customize program usage.
The 'def' has two functions: It specifies that the option takes an
argument and it tells find_option what to return if the option is
not present. If 'def' is given and the option does not have an
argument find_option will print an error message and exit the program.
<p>Also, as an extra bonus: shortform, longform and envvar can all be
arrays, in which case either of the options in the array will be
accpted.
</man_description>
<man_note>
find_option modifies argv.<br>
This function reads options even if they are written after the first
non-option on the line.
</man_note>
<man_example>
<pre><example language=pike>
/* This program tests two different options. One is called -f or
 * --foo and the other is called -b or --bar and can also be given
 * by using the BAR_OPTION environment variable.
 */

int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
{
  if(find_option(argv,"f","foo"))
    werror("The FOO option was given.\n");

<man_syntax>
array find_all_options(array(string) <i>argv</i>, array <i>option</i>, int|void <i>posix_me_harder</i>, int|void <i>throw_errors</i>);<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function does the job of several calls to <tt>find_option</tt>.
The main advantage of this is that it allows it to handle the
POSIX_ME_HARDER environment variable better. When the either
the argument <i>posix_me_harder</i> or the environment variable
POSIX_ME_HARDER is true, no arguments will be parsed after the first
non-option on the command line.
<p>
Each element in the array <i>options</i> should be an array on the
following form:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>({
<dd>string <i>name</i>,
<dd>int <i>type</i>,
<dd>string|array(string) <i>aliases</i>,
<dd>void|string|array(string) <i>env_var</i>,
<dd>void|mixed <i>default</i>
<dt>})
</dl>
Only the first three elements has to be included.
<dl>
<dt> <i>name</i>
<dd> Name is a tag used to identify the option in the output.
<dt> <i>type</i>
<dd> Type is one of Getopt.HAS_ARG, Getopt.NO_ARG and Getopt.MAY_HAVE_ARG
     and it affects how the error handling and parsing works.
     You should use HAS_ARG for options that require a path, a number or
     similar. NO_ARG should be used for options that do not need an
     argument, such as <tt>--version</tt>. MAY_HAVE_ARG should be used
     for options that may or may not need an argument.
<dt> <i>aliases</i>
<dd> This  is a string or an array of string of options that will be looked for.
     Short and long options can be mixed, and short options can be
     combined into one string. Note that you must include the dashes
     in <i>aliases</i> so find_all_options can distinguish between
      long and short options. Example: <tt>({"-tT","--test"})</tt>
      This would make find_all_options look for <tt>-t</tt>,
      <tt>-T</tt> and <tt>--test</tt>.
<dt> <i>env_var</i>
<dd> This is a string or an array of strings containing names of
     environment variables that can be used instead of the
     command line option.
<dt> <i>default</i>
<dd> This is the default value the option will have in the output
     from this function. Options without defaults will be omitted
     from the output if they are not found in argv.
</dl>
The good news is that the output from this function is a lot simpler.
Find_all_options returns an array where each element is an array on
this form:
<dl>
<dt>({
<dd>string <i>name</i>,
<dd>mixed <i>value</i>
<dt>})
</dl>
The <i>name</i> is the identifier from the input and <i>value</i> is the
value given to it from the argument, environment variable or <i>default</i>.
If no default is given, <i>value</i> will be 1.
</man_description>
<man_note>
find_all_options modifies argv.<br>
</man_note>
<man_example>
First let's take a look at input and output:
<pre>
&gt; Getopt.find_all_options(({"test","-dd"}),
&gt;&gt;  ({ ({ "debug", Getopt.NO_ARG, ({"-d","--debug"}), "DEBUG", 1}) }));
Result: ({
  ({ "debug",  1 }),
  ({ "debug",  1 })
})
</pre>
<p>
This is what it would look like in real code:
<example language=pike>
import Getopt;

int debug=0;

int main(int argc, array(string) argv
{

    mixed option)
  {
    switch(option[0])
    {
      case "debug": debug+=option[1]; break;
      case "version":
        write("Test program version 1.0\n");
        exit(1);
    }

<module name=Gz>
<section title="Gz">
The Gz module contains functions to compress and uncompress strings using
the same algorithm as the program <tt>gzip</tt>. Packing can be done in
streaming mode or all at once. Note that this module is only available if
the gzip library was available when Pike was compiled. The Gz module consists
of two classes; Gz.deflate and Gz.inflate. Gz.deflate is used to pack data
and Gz.inflate is used to unpack data. (Think "inflatable boat")
Note that these functions use the same <i>algorithm</i> as gzip, they do
not use the exact same format however, so you cannot directly unzip gzipped
files with these routines. Support for this will be added in the future.

This function is called when a new Gz.deflate is created.
If given, X should be a number from 0 to 9 indicating the packing /
CPU ratio. Zero means no packing, 2-3 is considered 'fast', 6 is
default and higher is considered 'slow' but gives better packing.
<p>This function can also be used to re-initialize a Gz.deflate object
so it can be re-used.

<method name=Gz.deflate-&gt;deflate title="pack data">
<man_syntax>
string deflate(string <I>data</I>, int <I>flush</I>);<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function performs gzip style compression on a string and
returns the packed data. Streaming can be done by calling this
function several times and concatenating the returned data.
The optional 'flush' argument should be one f the following:
<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr valign=top><td> Gz.NO_FLUSH       </td><td> Only data that doesn't fit in the internal buffers is returned. </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> Gz.PARTIAL_FLUSH </td><td> All input is packed and returned. </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> Gz.SYNC_FLUSH    </td><td> All input is packed and returned. </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td> Gz.FINISH        </td><td> All input is packed and an 'end of data' marker is appended. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>Using flushing will degrade packing. Normally NO_FLUSH should be
used until the end of the data when FINISH should be used. For
interactive data PARTIAL_FLUSH should be used.

<module name=ADT.Table>
<section title="ADT.Table">

ADT.Table is a generic module for manipulating tables. Each table contains one
or several columns. Each column is associated with a name, the column name.
Optionally, one can provide a column type. The Table module can do a number
of operations on a given table, like computing the sum of a column, grouping,
sorting etc.<p>

All column references are case insensitive. A column can be referred to by
its position (starting from zero). All operations are non-destructive. That
means that a new table object will be returned after, for example, a sort.<p>

An example is available at the end of this section.

<method name=ADT.Table.table-&gt;create title="create a table object">
<man_syntax>
void create(array(array) <i>table</i>, array(string) <i>column_names</i>, array(mapping)|void <i>column_types</i>);<br>
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
The table class takes two or three arguments:<p>
<ol>
<li></i>table</i> is a two-dimensional array consisting of one array of
columns per row. All rows must have the same number of columns as specified
in <i>column_names</i>.<p>
<li><i>column_names</i> is an array of column names associated with each
column in the table. References by column name are case insensitive. The
case used in <i>column_names</i> will be used when the table is displayed.
A column can also be referred to by its position, starting from zero.<p>
<li><i>column_types</i> is an optional array of mappings. The column type
information is only used when displaying the table. Currently, only the
keyword "type" is recognized. The type can be specified as "text" or
"num" (numerical). Text columns are left adjusted, whereas numerical
columns are right adjusted. If a mapping in the array is 0 (zero),
it will be assumed to be a text column. If <i>column_types</i> is
omitted, all columns will displayed as text. See
<link to=ADT.Table.ASCII.encode>ADT.Table.ASCII.encode</link> on how to
display a table.<p>

<module name=Yabu>
<section title="Yabu transaction database">

Yabu is a all purpose database, used to store data records associated with a
unique key. Yabu is very similar to mappings, however, records are
stored in files and not in memory. Also, Yabu features <i>tables</i>,
which is a way to handle several mapping-like structures in the same
database. A characteristic feature of Yabu is that it allows for
<i>transactions</i>. A transaction is a sequence of database commands
that will be accepted in whole, or not at all.<p>

Some effort has been made to make sure that Yabu is crash safe.
This means that the database should survive process kills, core
dumps and such -- although this is not something that can be absolutely
guaranteed. Also, all non-commited and pending transactions will
be cancelled in case of a crash.<p>

Yabu uses three types of objects, listed below:<p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>db</i> object is the main database object. It can create
    table objects. The methods available in the db object are:
    <link to=Yabu.db.table><tt>table</tt></link> (the <tt>[]</tt> operator),
    <link to=Yabu.db.list_tables><tt>list_tables</tt></link>
    (<tt>indices</tt>),
    <link to=Yabu.db.sync><tt>sync</tt></link> and
    <link to=Yabu.db.purge><tt>purge</tt></link>.
<li>The <i>table</i> object handles tables. It is used in order to
    store and fetch records from the database. It can create transaction
    objects. The methods available in the table object are:
    <link to=Yabu.table.set><tt>set</tt></link> (the <tt>[]=</tt> operator),
    <link to=Yabu.table.get><tt>get</tt></link> (the <tt>[]</tt> operator),
    <link to=Yabu.table.list_keys><tt>list_keys</tt></link> (<tt>indices</tt>),
    <link to=Yabu.table.delete><tt>delete</tt></link>,
    <link to=Yabu.table.transaction><tt>transaction</tt></link> and
    <link to=Yabu.table.purge><tt>purge</tt></link>.
<li>The <i>transaction</i> object handles transactions. It works
    like the table object. The difference is that a sequence of commands
    must end with <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt>. The methods available
    in the table object are:
    <link to=Yabu.table.set><tt>set</tt></link> (the <tt>[]=</tt> operator),
    <link to=Yabu.table.get><tt>get</tt></link> (the <tt>[]</tt> operator),
    <link to=Yabu.table.list_keys><tt>list_keys</tt></link> (<tt>indices</tt>),
    <link to=Yabu.table.delete><tt>delete</tt></link>,
    <link  to=Yabu.transaction.commit><tt>commit</tt></link> and
    <link  to=Yabu.transaction.rollback><tt>rollback</tt></link>.
</ul><p>

A simple example is illustrated below.<p>

<man_example>
<example language=pike>

// Create a database called "my.database" in write/create mode.
object db = Yabu.db("my.database", "wc");

// Create a table called "fruit".
object table = db["fruit"];

// Store a record called "orange" with the value "yummy".
table["orange"] = "yummy";

// Store a record called "apple" with the value 42.
table["apple"] = 42;
</example>
</man_example><p>

Transactions are slightly more complex, but not much so. See example
below.

<man_example>
<example language=pike>

// Create a database called "my.database"
// in write/create/transaction mode.
object db = Yabu.db("my.database", "wct");

// Create a table called "fruit".
object table = db["fruit"];

// Create a transaction object for table "fruit".
object transaction = table->transaction();

// Store a record called "orange" with
// the value "yummy". Note that this record
// is only visible through the transaction object.
transaction["orange"] = "yummy";

// Store a record called "apple" with the value 42.
// As with "orange", this record is invisible
// for all objects except this transaction object.
transaction["apple"] = 42;

// Commit the records "orange" and "apple".
// These records are now a part of the database.
transaction->commit();

</example>
</man_example>

<section title="The database">

The db object is the main Yabu database object. It is used to open
the database and it can create table objects.<p>

A Yabu database can operate in two basic modes:<p>

<ul>
<li> Read mode. In read mode, nothing in the database can be altered,
     added nor deleted. All Yabu files will be opended in read mode, which
     means that the database will be in the same state on the disk as it
     was prior to the opening.
<li> Write mode. In write mode, records can be altered, added or deleted. In
     combination with create mode, new tables can also be added. Transactions
     can optionally be used with write mode. When compressed mode is enabled,
     all records will be compressed before stored on to disk.
</ul>

Compressed databases opened without compress mode enabled will be handled
correctly in both modes, provided that the Gz module is available.
However, new records will no longer be compressed in write mode.<p>

<method name=Yabu.db-&gt;create title="Open a Yabu database">
<man_syntax>
void create(string <i>directory</i>, string <i>mode</i>);
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
Create takes two arguments:<p>
<ol>
<li><i>directory</i> is a string specifying the directory where Yabu will
store its files. Yabu will create the directory if it does not exist,
provided Yabu is opened in write and create mode (see below).<p>
<li><i>mode</i> is a string specifying the mode in which Yabu will
operate. There are five switches available:<p>
<ul>
<li>"r" - Read mode. No database entries can be altered and no files will
be modified.<p>
<li>"c" - Create mode. The database can create new tables. Create mode is
only used togheter with write mode.<p>
<li>"w" - Write mode. The database can be altered and the files will be
updates accordingly.<p>
<li>"t" - Transaction mode. The database now allows transactions.<p>
<li>"C" - Compress mode. Provided the <link to=Gz>Gz module</link> is
available, all records will be compressed before stored on to disk.<p>
</ul>
</ol>
</man_description>

<man_note>
It is very important not to open the same a database more than
once at a time. Otherwise there will be conflicts and most likely
strange failures and unpredictable behaviours. Yabu does not check
weather a database is already open or not.
</man_note>

<man_example>
<example language=pike>
// Open a database in create/write/transaction mode.
object db = Yabu.db("my.database", "cwt");

// Open a database in read mode.
object db = Yabu.db("my.database", "r");

// Open a database in create/write/compress mode.
object db = Yabu.db("my.database", "cwC");

<section title="Transactions">

Transactions make it possible to alter, add or delete several database
records and guarantee that all changes, or no changes, will be accepted
by the database. A transaction object is basically a table object with
a few restrictions and additions, listed below:<p>

<ul>
<li>Purge is not available in a transaction object.
<li>Commit. In order to make all changes take affect, commit must be
    issued at the end of a transaction sequence. Changes done by a
    transaction object will never take affect before commit,
    even if the database is shut down, the program crashes etc.
<li>Rollback. A rollback cancels all changes made by the transaction object.
</ul><p>

Rollbacks always succeeds. However, with commit that is not always
the case. A commit will fail if:<p>

<ul>
<li>A record that is altered by the transaction object is altered
    again by something else, before commit. This is called a conflict,
    and will result in an error upon commit.

<a href="http://www.roxen.com/rfc/rfc1521.txt">RFC1521</a>, the
<b>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</b> memo, defines a
structure which is the base for all messages read and written by modern mail
and news programs.  It is also partly the base for the HTTP protocol.
Just like <a href="http://www.roxen.com/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC822</a>,
MIME declares that a message should consist of two entities,
the headers and the body.  In addition, the following properties are given
to these two entities:

<dl>
<dt>Headers
<dd><ul>
<li>A MIME-Version header must be present to signal MIME compatibility
<li>A Content-Type header should be present to describe the nature of the
data in the message body.  Seven major types are defined, and an extensive
number of subtypes are available.  The header can also contain attributes
specific to the type and subtype.
<li>A Content-Transfer-Encoding may be present to notify that the data of
the body is encoded in some particular encoding.
</ul>
<dt>Body
<dd><ul>
<li>Raw data to be interpreted according to the Content-Type header
<li>Can be encoded using one of several Content-Transfer-Encodings to
allow transport over non 8bit clean channels
</ul>
</dl>

The MIME module can extract and analyze these two entities from a stream
of bytes.  It can also recreate such a stream from these entities.
To encapsulate the headers and body entities, the class MIME.Message is
used.  An object of this class holds all the headers as a mapping from
string to string, and it is possible to obtain the body data in either
raw or encoded form as a string.  Common attributes such as message type and
text char set are also extracted into separate variables for easy access.

<p>
The Message class does not make any interpretation of the body data, unless
the content type is <tt>multipart</tt>.  A multipart message contains several
individual messages separated by boundary strings.  The <tt>create</tt>
method of the Message class will divide a multipart body on these boundaries,
and then create individual Message objects for each part.  These objects
will be collected in the array <tt>body_parts</tt> within the original
Message object.  If any of the new Message objects have a body of type
multipart, the process is of course repeated recursively.  The following
figure illustrates a multipart message containing three parts, one of
which contains plain text, one containing a graphical image, and the third
containing raw uninterpreted data:

This function will attempt to reassemble a fragmented message from its
parts.  The array <i>collection</i> should contain <tt>MIME.Message</tt>
objects forming a complete set of parts for a single fragmented message.
The order of the messages in this array is not important, but every part

<p>
Should the function succeed in reconstructing the original message, a
new <tt>MIME.Message</tt> object is returned.  Note that this message may
in turn be a part of another, larger, fragmented message.
If the function fails to reconstruct an original message, it returns an
integer indicating the reason for its failure:
<ul>
<li>If an empty <i>collection</i> is passed in, or one that contains messages
which are not of type <tt>message/partial</tt>, or parts of different
fragmented messages, the function returns 0.
<li>If more fragments are needed to reconstruct the entire message, the

A structured header field, as specified by RFC822, is constructed from
a sequence of lexical elements.  These are:
<ul>
<li>individual special characters
<li>quoted-strings
<li>domain-literals
<li>comments
<li>atoms
</ul>
This function will analyze a string containing the header value, and produce
an array containing the lexical elements.  Individual special characters
will be returned as characters (i.e. <tt>int</tt>s).  Quoted-strings,
domain-literals and atoms will be decoded and returned as strings.
Comments are not returned in the array at all.

    59,
    "boundary",
    61,
    "foo/bar"
})
</pre>
</man_example>
<man_note>
As domain-literals are returned as strings, there is no way to tell the
domain-literal <tt>[127.0.0.1]</tt> from the quoted-string
<tt>"[127.0.0.1]"</tt>.  Hopefully this won't cause any problems.
Domain-literals are used seldom, if at all, anyway...
<p>
The set of special-characters is the one specified in RFC1521 (i.e. <tt>"&lt;",

</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This method tries to find a suitable filename should you want to save the
body data to disk.  It will examine the <tt>filename</tt> attribute of the
<tt>Content-Disposition</tt> header, and failing that the <tt>name</tt>
attribute of the <tt>Content-Type</tt> header.  If neither attribute is set,
the method returns 0.

<man_description>
If this message is a part of a fragmented message (i.e. has a Content-Type
of <tt>message/partial</tt>), an array with three elements is returned.
The first element is an identifier string.  This string should be used to
group this message with the other fragments of the message (which will have
the same id string).  The second element is the sequence number of this
fragment.  The first part will have number 1, the next number 2 etc.
The third element of the array is either the total number of fragments
that the original message has been split into, or 0 of this information
was not available.  If this method is called in a message that is not
a part of a fragmented message, it will return 0.

<module name=Simulate title="Compatibility functions">
<section title="Simulate">
This module is used to achieve better compatibility with older versions of
Pike. It can also be used for convenience, but I would advice against it
since some functions defined here are much slower than using similar
functions in other modules. The purpose of this section in the manual is
to make it easier for the reader to understand code that uses the Simulate
module, not to encourage the use of the Simulate module.
<p>
Simulate inherits the Array, Stdio, String and Process modules, so
importing he Simulate module also imports all identifiers from these
modules. In addition, these functions are available:

<chapter title="The preprocessor">
<anchor name=preprocessor>
Pike has a builtin C-style preprocessor. The preprocessor reads the source
before it is compiled and removes comments and expands macros. The preprocessor
can also remove code depending on an expression that is evaluated when you
compile the program. The preprocessor helps to keep your programming abstract
by using defines instead of writing the same constant everywhere. 
<p>
It currently works similar to old C preprocessors but has a few extra features.
This chapter describes the different preprocessor directives. This is
what it can do:

<hr noshade size=1>
<dl>
<dt><encaps>DIRECTIVE</encaps><dd>
<tt>#!<br>
</tt>
<p>
<dt><encaps>DESCRIPTION</encaps><dd>
This directive is in effect a comment statement, since the
preprocessor will ignore everything to the end of the line.
This is used to write Unix type scripts in Pike by starting
the script with
<p>#!/usr/local/bin/pike

<p>
</dl>

<hr noshade size=1>
<anchor name=define>
<dl>
<dt><encaps>DIRECTIVE</encaps><dd>
<tt>#define<br>
</tt>
<p>
<dt><encaps>DESCRIPTION</encaps><dd>
The simplest way to use define is to write
<p><dl><dt><dd>#define &lt;identifier&gt; &lt;replacement string&gt;<br>
</dl>
<p>which will cause all subsequent occurrences of 'identifier' to be
replaced with the replacement string.
<p>Define also has the capability to use arguments, thus a line like
<p><dl><dt><dd>#define &lt;identifier&gt;(arg1, arg2) &lt;replacement string&gt;<br>
</dl>
<p>would cause identifier to be a macro. All occurrences of
'identifier(something1,something2d)' would be replaced with
the replacement string. And in the replacement string, arg1 and arg2
will be replaced with something1 and something2.
<p>
<dt><encaps>BUGS</encaps><dd>
Note that it is not a good idea to do something like this:
<p>#define foo bar // a comment
<p>The comment will be included in the define, and thus inserted in the
code. This will have the effect that the rest of the line will be
ignored when the word foo is used. Not exactly what you might expect.
<dt><encaps>EXAMPLE</encaps><dd>
<example language=pike>
#define A "test"
#define B 17
#define C(X) (X)+(B)+"\n"
#define W write
#define Z Stdio.stdout
int main()
{
  Z->W(C(A));
}
</example>
<p>
</dl>

</anchor>
<hr noshade size=1>
<anchor name=undef>
<dl>
<dt><encaps>DIRECTIVE</encaps><dd>
<tt>#undef<br>
</tt>
<p>
<dt><encaps>DESCRIPTION</encaps><dd>
This removes the effect of a #define, all subsequent occurrences of
the undefined identifier will not be replaced by anything. Note that
when undefining a macro, you just give the identifier, not the
arguments.
<p>
<dt><encaps>EXAMPLES</encaps><dd>
<tt>#define foo bar<br>
#undef foo<br>
#define foo(bar) gazonk bar<br>
#undef foo<br>

<dt><encaps>DIRECTIVE</encaps><dd>
<tt>#if<br>
#elif<br>
#elseif<br>
#else<br>
#endif<br>
</tt>
<p>
<dt><encaps>DESCRIPTION</encaps><dd>
The #if directive causes conditional compiling of code depending on
the expression after the #if directive. That is, if the expression
is true, the code up to the next #else, #elif, #elseif or #endif is
compiled. If the expression is false, that code will be skipped.
If the skip leads up to a #else, the code after the else will be
compiled. #elif and #elseif are equivalent and causes the code that
follow them to be compiled if the previous #if or #elif evaluated
false and the expression after the #elif evaluates true.
<p>Expressions given to #if, #elif or #endif are special, all identifiers
evaluate to zero unless they are defined to something else. Integers,
strings and floats are the only types that can be used, but all pike
operators can be used on these types.
<p>
Also, two special functions can be used, <tt>defined()</tt> and <tt>constant()</tt>.
<tt>defined(<i>identifier</i>)</tt> expands to 1 if <i>identifier</i> is defined and
0 otherwise. <tt>constant(<i>identifier</i>)</tt> expands to 1 if <i>identifier</i> is
an predefined constant (with add_constant), 0 otherwise.

This directive tells the compiler what line and file we are compiling.
This is for instance used by the #include directive to tell the
compiler that we are compiling another file. The directive takes
the line number first, and optionally, the file afterwards.
<p>This can also be used when generating Pike from something else, to
tell the compiler where the code originally originated from.

<chapter title="All the builtin functions" name=functions>

This chapter is a reference for all the builtin functions in Pike.
They are listed in alphabetical order.

<HR NEWPAGE>

<function name=_disable_threads title="temporarily disable threads" fullpath>
<man_syntax>
object _disable_threads();
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function first posts a notice to all threads that it is time to stop.
It then waits until all threads actually *have* stopped, and then then 
returns an object. All other threads will be blocked from running until
that object has been freed/destroyed. This function can completely block
Pike if used incorrectly. Use with extreme caution.
</man_description>
</function>

<HR NEWPAGE>

<function name=_exit title="Really exit" fullpath>
<man_syntax>
void _exit(int <i>returncode</I>);
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function does the same as <tt>exit</tt>, but doesn't bother to clean
up the Pike interpreter before exiting. This means that no destructors
will be called, caches will not be flushed, file locks might not be released,
and databases might not be closed properly. Use with extreme caution.
</man_description>
<man_see>
exit
</man_see>
</function>

<HR NEWPAGE>

<function name=_locate_references title="locate where an object is referenced from">
<man_syntax>
mapping(string:int) _locate_references(string|array|mapping|multiset|function|object|program <i>o</i>);
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function is mostly intended for debugging. It will search through
all data structures in Pike looking for <i>o</i> and print the
locations on stderr. <i>o</i> can be anything but <tt>int</tt> or
<tt>float</tt>.
</man_description>
</function>

<HR NEWPAGE>

<function name=_memory_usage title="check memory usage">
<man_syntax>
mapping(string:int) _memory_usage();
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
This function is mostly intended for debugging. It delivers a mapping
with information about how many arrays/mappings/strings etc. there
are currently allocated and how much memory they use. Try evaluating
the function in hilfe to see precisely what it returns.
</man_description>
<man_see>
_verify_internals
</man_see>
</function>

<HR NEWPAGE>

<function name=_next title="find the next object/array/whatever">
<man_syntax>
mixed _next(mixed <I>p</I>);
</man_syntax>
<man_description>
All objects, arrays, mappings, multisets, programs and strings are stored in linked lists
inside Pike. This function returns the next object/array/mapping/string/etc
in the linked list. It is mainly meant for debugging Pike but
can also be used to control memory usage.

This function allows you to trap a signal and have a function called
when the process receives a signal. Although it IS possible to trap
SIGBUS, SIGSEGV etc. I advice you not to. Pike should not receive any
such signals and if it does it is because of bugs in the Pike
interpreter. And all bugs should be reported, no matter how trifle.
<p>The callback will receive the signal number as the only argument.
See the document for the function 'kill' for a list of signals.
<p>If no second argument is given, the signal handler for that signal
is restored to the default handler.

If extra arguments are given, they are supposed to be arrays of the

'index'. I.e. if index 3 is moved to position 0 in 'index' index 3
will be moved to position 0 in all the other arrays as well.

Arrays will be sorted first on the first element of each array.

When doing a find_call_out or mapping lookup, zero_type on this value
will return 1 if there was no such thing present in the mapping, or
no such call_out could be found. If the argument to zero_type is a
destructed object or a function in a destructed object, 2 will be
returned. Otherwise zero_type will return zero.
<p>If the argument is not an int, zero will be returned.

<chapter title="Pike internals - how to extend Pike">
The rest of this book describes how Pike works and how to extend it with
your own functions written in C or C++. Even if you are not interested in
extending Pike, the information in this section can make you understand
Pike better and thus make you a better Pike programmer. From this point on
I will assume that the reader knows C or C++.
<p>
<section title="The master object">
Pike is a very dynamic language. Sometimes that is not enough, sometimes you
want to change the way Pike handles errors, loads modules or start scripts.
All this and much more can be changed by modifying the <b>master object</b>.
The <b>master object</b> is a Pike object like any other object, but it is
loaded before anything else and is expected to perform certain things for
the Pike executable. The Pike executable cannot function without a master
object to take care of these things. Here is a list of the methods needed
in the <b>master object</b>:
<dl>
<dt> <tt>program cast_to_program(string <i>program_name</i>, string <i>current_file</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is called whenever someone performs a cast from a string
     to a program.
<dt> <tt>program handle_inherit(string <i>program_name</i>, string <i>current_file</i>)</tt>
<dd> This is called whenever a Pike program which uses inherit with a string
     argument is called. It is expected to return the program to inherit.
<dt> <tt>void handle_error(array <i>trace</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is expected to write the error messages when a
     run time error occurs. The argument is of the form
     <tt>({"<i>error_description</i>", backtrace() })</tt>. If any error
     occurs in this routine Pike will dump core.
<dt> <tt>program cast_to_program(string <i>program_name</i>, string <i>current_file</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is called whenever someone performs a cast from a string
     to an object.
<dt> <tt>mixed resolv(string <i>identifier</i>, string <i>current_file</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is called whenever the compiler finds an unknown identifier
     in a program. It is normally used for loading modules.
     It is supposed to return <tt>([])[0]</tt> if the master doesn't know what
     the value should be, and the value in question otherwise.
<dt> <tt>void _main(array(string) <i>argv</i>, array(string) <i>env</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is supposed to start a Pike script. It receives all
     the command line arguments in the first array and all environment
     variables on the form <tt>"<i>var</i>=<i>value</i>"</tt>.
     _main is called as soon as all modules and setup is done.
<dt> <tt>void compile_error(string <i>file</i>, int <i>line</i>, string <i>err</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is called whenever a compile error is encountered. Normally
     it just writes a message to stderr.
<dt> <tt>string handle_include(string <i>file</i>, string <i>current_file</i>, int <i>local_include</i>)</tt>
<dd> This function is used to locate include files. <i>file</i> is the file
     name the user wants to include, and <i>local_include</i> is 1 if
     the user used double quotes rather than lesser-than, greater-than to
     quote the file name. Otherwise it is zero.
</dl>
<p>
Aside from the above functions, which are expected from the Pike binary,
the master object is also expected to provide functions used by Pike
scripts. The current master add the following global functions:
<dl><dd>
	add_include_path,
	remove_include_path,
	add_module_path,
	remove_module_path,
	add_program_path,
	remove_program_path,
	master,
	describe_backtrace,
	mkmultiset,
	strlen,
	new,
	clone,
	UNDEFINED,
	write,
	getenv and putenv.
</dl>
<p>
There are at least two ways to change the behavior of the master object.
(Except for editing it directly, which would cause other Pike scripts not
 to run in most cases.) You can either copy the master object, modify it
and use the command line option <tt>-m</tt> to load your file instead of
the default master object. However, since there might be more functionality
added to the master object in the future I do not recommend this.
<p>
A better way is to write an object that inherits the master and then calls
replace_master with the new object as argument. This should be far more
future-safe. Although I can not guarantee that the interface between Pike
and the master object will not change in the future, so be careful if you
do this.
<p>
Let's look an example:
<example language=pike>
	#!/usr/local/bin/pike

	class new_master {
	  inherit "/master";

 	  void create()
 	  {
 	    /* You need to copy the values from the old master to the new */
 	    /* NOTE: At this point we are still using the old master */
 	    object old_master = master();
 	    object new_master = this_object();
 
 	    foreach(indices(old_master), string varname)
 	    {
 	      /* The catch is needed since we can't assign constants */
 	      catch { new_master[varname] = old_master[varname]; };
 	    }
 	  }

	  void handle_error(array trace)
	  {
	    Stdio.write_file("error log",describe_backtrace(trace));
	  }
	};

	int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
	{
	  replace_master(new_master());
	  /* Run rest of program */
	  exit(0);
	}
</example>
This example installs a master object which logs run time errors to file
instead of writing them to stderr.

<appendix title="How to install Pike" name=install>
To install Pike, you need a C compiler, a couple of Mb of disk space,
the source for Pike, and a bit of patience. The latest version of Pike is
always available from <a href=http://pike.idonex.se>the Pike home page</a>.
Lists of mirror sites and binary releases should also be available there.
Pike should compile and install nicely on almost any UNIX platform. It has
been tested on the following:
<ul>
<li> Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6
<li> Linux Red Hat, Slackware, Debian etc.
<li> Digital Unix (OSF/1)
<li> HP-UX 10
<li> AIX 4
<li> IRIX
<li> NetBSD 2.2.2
<li> SunOs 4.1.1, 4.1.3
<li> SCO UNIX
<li> Ultrix
</ul>

After obtaining the Pike source you need to unpack it. To unpack Pike you
need gzip, which is available from any GNU mirror site. You also need tar,
which is a part of UNIX. If you got Pike-v0.6.105.tar.gz, simply unpack it by
typing:
<pre>
	$ gunzip -d Pike-v0.6.105.tar.gz
	$ tar xvf Pike-v0.5.105.tar
</pre>

Now you have a directory called Pike-v0.6.53. Please read the README file
in the new directory since newer versions can contain information not
available at the time this book was written.
<p>
Now, to compile Pike, the following three commands should be enough.
<pre>
	$ cd Pike-v0.6.105/src
	$ ./configure --prefix=/dir/to/install/pike
	$ make
</pre>
They will (in order) change directory to the source directory. Configure will
then find out what features are available on your system and construct
makefiles. You will see a lot of output after you run configure. Do not
worry, that is normal. It is usually not a good idea to install Pike anywhere
but in /usr/local (the default) since Pike scripts written by other people
will usually assume that's where Pike is. However, if you do not have write
access to /usr/local you will have to install Pike somewhere else on your
system.
<p>
After that <tt>make</tt> will actually compile the program. After compilation
it is a good idea to do <tt>make verify</tt> to make sure that Pike is
100% compatible with your system. Make verify will take a while to run
and use a lot of CPU, but it is worth it to see that your compilation was
successful. After doing that you should run <tt>make install</tt> to install
the Pike binaries, libraries and include files in the directory you selected
earlier.
<p>
You are now ready to use Pike.
