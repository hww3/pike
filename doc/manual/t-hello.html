<h1>Hello world!</h1>

In this chapter, you will learn to write a complete program in the
킠PC language. All this program does is to print "Hello world!" on
your screen. You can then make additions and changes to the program,
as you learn to handle more features of the language in the following
chapters.

<p>This is typical for how you develop programs in 킠PC: step by step,
making them more advanced, adding functionality, as you go.  Since
킠PC is an interpreted language, you don't get lagged by frequent
recompilations.  You just change the program, and it is ready to run.

<p>Enough said!  Let's take a look at the program now:

<pre>
        #!/usr/local/bin/ulpc

        int main(int argc, string *argv)
        {
          write ("Hello world!\n");
	  return 0;
        }
</pre>

<p>That's all there is!  Use your favorite text editor and save the
results in a file called <b>hello.lpc</b>.

<p>We are not quite ready to run yet.  First, you must use the
<b>chmod</b> command to make your program executable.  You only have
to do this once for each program.  Here, the dollar sign is your UNIX
prompt, which could also be any odd character (such as % or #).

<pre>
        $ chmod +x hello.lpc
        $ hello.lpc
        Hello world!
        $
</pre>

<p>Obviously, our program is a success!  Let's try and understand why.

<p>The first line of <b>hello.lpc</b> starts with the two characters
<b>#!</b> (hash bang) followed by a file name. This is a UNIX trick to
make script programs executable.  Normally, scripts are written in
shell commands, awk or perl.  All script programs need an interpreter
to read the script commands and execute them.  The "hash bang" tells
UNIX that the this is a script file and that the file name of an
interpreter follows.  For example, shell scripts use a UNIX shell
/bin/sh as their interpreter, so their first line should be #!/bin/sh.

<dl>
<dt>NOTE:

<dd>For this to work properly, the "hash bang" (#!) must be the first
two characters of the file.  There must not be any white space before
or empty line above them!

</dl>

<p>For 킠PC programs, the interpreter is the <b>ulpc</b> program,
which we shall assume is installed in <b>/usr/local/bin</b>
directory.  Turn to appendices A and B if this program is not
properly installed on your computer.

<p>The next few lines of the program ... (to be continued)
