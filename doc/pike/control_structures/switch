NAME
	switch - Complicated conditional statement

SYNTAX
	switch( expression )
	{
	  case constant1:
	    <statement1>
	
	  case constant2:
	    <statement2>
	    break;
	
	  case constant3..constant4:
	    <statement4>
	    break;
	
	  default:
	    <statement3>
	}

DESCRIPTION
	Switch evaluates the expression give and then executes one or more
	statement accordingly to the result. If the result is equal to
	constant1 then statement1 will be executed, please observe that
	the second case-statement dos _not_ abort the execution in any way
	instead statement2 will also be executed. After that break will
	cause execution to continue after the after the last } in the
	switch statement. If the result is equal to constant2 only
	statement2 will be executed. If expression <= consant3 and
	expression >= constant4, statement4 will be executed. In all other
	cases statement3 is executed because it is 'default'. Please note
	that the expression and constants can be any type that can be
	written as a constant. Arrays, mappings and multisets have little or
	no use though.
