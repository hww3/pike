SYNTAX
	a == b
	or
	int `==(mixed a, mixed b)

DESCRIPTION
	This operator compares two values and returns 1 if they are the same,
	0 otherwise. Note that pointer equivialenec is required for arrays,
	objects, programs, mappings and lists. (Thus it is not enough that
	two arrays LOOK alike, it must be the same array.)
