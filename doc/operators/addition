NAME
	addition - add things together

SYNTAX
	a + b
	or
	mixed sum(mixed ...)

DESCRIPTION
	For ints and floats this operator simply adds the two operators
	together. For strings and arrays, concatenation is done. For lists
	and mapping this creates a new list with all indices and data as
	in a and b. Note that this can cause a list or mapping to contain
	several equal indices. Also, when adding a string to an int or float
	the number is converted to a printable string first.

EXAMPLES
	"a"+10		returns "a10"
	10+20		returns 30
	({1})+({2})	returns ({1,2})
	(<1>)+(<1>)	returns (<1,1>)

	subtraction, efun/sum, multiplication
