DESCRIPTION
	This is the negation and subtraction operator, for ints and floats
	the operation should be obvious.

	For arrays, an array containing all elements present in a and not in
	b is returne. The order of the remaining values from a will be kept.

	For lists, the same operation is done as for arrays, except order is
	of course not considered.

	For mappings, a mapping is returned with every key-index pair from
	a whos index is not present as an index in b.
