NAME
	thread_create - create a thread

SYNTAX
	int thread_create(function f, mixed ... args);

DESCRIPTION
	This function creates a new thread which will run simultaneously
	to the rest of the program. The new thread will call the function
	f with the arguments args. When f returns the thread will cease
	to exist. All Pike functions are 'thread safe' meanting that running
	a function at the same time from different threads will not corrupt
	any internal data in the Pike process.

NOTA BENE
	This function is only available on systems with POSIX threads support.
