NAME
	equal - check if two values are equal or not

SYNTAX
	int equal(mixed a, mixed b);

DESCRIPTION
	This function checks if the values a and b are equal. For all types but
	arrays, lists and mappings, this operation is the same as doing a == b.
	For arrays, mappings and lists however, their contents are checked
	recursively, and if all their contents are the same and in the same
	place, they are considered equal.

EXAMPLES
	> ({ 1 }) == ({ 1 });
	Result: 0
	> equal( ({ 1 }), ({ 1 }) );
	Result: 1
	>
