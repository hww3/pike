NAME
	gc - do garbage collection

SYNTAX
	int gc();

DESCRIPTION
	This function checks all the memory for cyclic structures such
	as arrays containing themselves and frees them if approperiate.
	It also frees up destructed objects. It then returns how many
	arrays/objects/programs/etc. it managed	to free by doing this.
	
	Normally there is no need to call this function since uLPC will
	call it by itself every now and then. (uLPC will try to predict
	when 20% of all arrays/object/programs in memory is 'garbage'
	and call this routine then.)
