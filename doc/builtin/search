NAME
	search - search for a value in a string or array

SYNTAX
	int search(string haystack, string needle, [ int start ]);
	or
	int search(mixed *haystack, mixed needle, [ int start ]);
	or
	mixed search(mapping haystack, mixed needle, [ mixed start ]);

DESCRIPTION
	Search for needle in haystack. Return the position of needle in
	haystack or -1 if not found. If the optional argument start is present
	search is started at this position. Note that when haystack is a string
	needle must be a string, and the first occurance of this string is
	returned. However, when haystack is an array, needle is compared only
	to one value at a time in haystack.

	When the haystack is a mapping, search tries to find the index
	connected to the data needle. That is, it tries to lookup the mapping
	backwards. If needle isn't present in the mapping, zero is returned,
	and zero_type() will return 1 for this zero.

NOTA BENE
	This function replaces strstr and member_array from LPC4.

KEYWORDS
	string, array, mapping
