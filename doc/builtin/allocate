NAME
	allocate - allocate an array

SYNTAX
	mixed *allocate(int size, [ string type ]);

DESCRIPTION
	Allocate an array of size elements. Optionally, write what type you
	want to store in the array in the second argument as a string.
	Note that the type given in this string should be simple, instead
	of writing "int ***" just write "array".

EXAMPLES
	mixed *a=allocate(17);
	int *b=allocate(17, "int");
	int **c=allocate(17, "array");
	mapping *c=allocate(17, "mapping");
	array (list (int)) c=allocate(17, "list");
	array (string) c=allocate(17, "string");

NOTA BENE
	Arrays are dynamically allocated there is no need to declare them
	like int a[10]=allocate(10); (and it isn't possible either) like
	in C, just int *a=allocate(10); will do.

SEE ALSO
	sizeof, aggregate, arrayp
