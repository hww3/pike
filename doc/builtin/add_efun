NAME
	add_efun - add new predefined functions or constants

SYNTAX
	void add_efun(string name, mixed value);
	or
	void add_efun(string name);

DESCRIPTION
	This function adds a new constant to uLPC, it is often used to
	add builin functions (efuns). All programs compiled after add_efun
	function is called can access 'value' by the name given by 'name'.
	If there is an efun called 'name' already, it will be replaced by
	by the new definition. This will not affect already compiled programs.

	Calling add_efun without a value will remove that name from the list
 	of of efuns. As with replacing, this will not affect already compiled
	programs.

EXAMPLES
	add_efun("true",1);
	add_efun("false",0);
	add_efun("PI",4.0);
	add_efun("sqr",lambda(mixed x) { return x * x; });
	add_efun("add_efun");
