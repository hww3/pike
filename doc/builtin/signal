NAME
	signal - trap signals

SYNTAX
	void signal(int sig, function(int:void) callback);
	or
	void signal(int sig);

DESCRIPTION
	This function allows you to trap a signal and have a function called
	when the process receives a signal. Although it IS possible to trap
	SIGBUS, SIGSEGV etc. I advice you not to. uLPC should not receive any
	such signals and if it does it is because of bugs in the uLPC
	interperter. And all bugs should be reported, no matter how trifle.

	The callback will receive the signal number as the only argument.
	See the document for the function 'kill' for a list of signals.

	If no second argument is given, the signal handler for that signal
	is restored to the default handler.

	kill, signame, signum
