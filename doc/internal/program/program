NAME
	program - internal representation of a program

DESCRIPTION
	A 'struct program' is basically what C++ hackers call a 'class'.
	It contains the byte code, information about line numbers,
	global variables etc. etc. Mostly you won't have to bother with
	any of the contents of a 'struct program'. Usually you only need
	to create them with start_new_program()/end_c_program() or
	clone them with clone().
