NAME
	object - internal representation of an object

DESCRIPTION
	Pike uses a 'struct object' with all the global variables
	allocated in the same block to represent the Pike type 'object'.
	An object without any global variables is only the size of 4 C
	pointers. (usually 16 bytes) The only important members of the
	'struct object' are the ref counts and the pointer to the
	program from which the object was cloned.

KEYWORDS
	internals
