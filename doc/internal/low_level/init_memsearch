NAME
	init_memsearch - initialize a memory search struct

SYNTAX
	#include "memory.h"

	void init_memsearch(struct mem_searcher *s,
			    char *needle,
			    SIZE_T needlelen,
			    SIZE_T max_haystacklen);

DESCRIPTION
	This function initializes a struct mem_searcher to be used with
	the function memory_search. 'needle' is the byte sequence to
	search for, and needlelen is how many bytes long the 'needle' is.
	The argument 'max_haystacklen' is an approximation of how much
	this memory searcher will be used. More time will be spent optimizing
	the memory searcher struct if max_haystacklen is large.

NOTA BENE
	The needle is not copied by this function. It must still be available
	when memory_search is called.
