NAME
	hashmem - hash a memory region

SYNTAX
	#include "memory.h"

	unsigned INT32 hashmem(const unsigned char *a,INT32 len,INT32 mlen);

DESCRIPTION
	This function looks at the memory region beginning at 'a' and is 'len'
	bytes long and returns a hash value depending on the bytes in that
	region. The argument 'mlen' is how many bytes it should actually look
	at, larger mlen gives better values but slower hashing.
