NAME
	memory_search - search memory for a sequence of bytes

SYNTAX
	#include "memory.h"
	
	char *memory_search(struct mem_searcher *s,
			    char *haystack,
			    SIZE_T haystacklen);

DESCRIPTION
	This function searches through a memory region (called 'haystack')
	for a sequence of bytes (called 'needle'). If found, a pointer to
	the first occurance of 'needle' in 'haystack' is returned. The needle
	is given by calling init_memsearch to initialize a struct mem_searcher
	that can then be used with this function.
