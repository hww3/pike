NAME
	reorder - re-order an array of memory blocks

SYNTAX
	#include "memory.h"

	void reorder(char *memory, INT32 nitems, INT32 size,INT32 *order);

DESCRIPTION
	This function takes an array of memory blocks and re-organizes them
	according to the argument 'order'. 'nitems' tells how many memory
	blocks there are, and 'size' tells how big they are in bytes.
	'order' is simply an array of INT32 of size 'nitems' in which each
	int tells which memory block from 'memory' should be placed in that
	position. In pseudo code, this could be written as:

	mem_copy=copy_memory(memory);
	for(int e=0;e<nitems;e++)
	  memory[e]=mem_copy[order[e]];
