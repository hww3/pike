NAME
	xalloc - fail-safe memory allocation

SYNTAX
	#include "memory.h"

	char *xalloc(long size);

DESCRIPTION
	This function works exactly like the malloc() function, it will
	never return NULL. Instead it will try to free up any pike resources
	that are not needed any longer and try again. If that doesn't work
	either it will call fatal("out of memory\n"); and Pike will dump core.
	This type of error handling makes it easier to code, but is not
	always what you want.
