NAME
	frame - the current frame of exectution

DESCRIPTION
	The frame pointer is called 'fp' and is of type 'struct frame'.
	The frame pointer contains information about what function we
	are executing in, what is the current object, the current program,
	where the local variables are etc. It also contains a pointer to
	the previous frame in the call stack. The most important members
	of 'fp' are:

	current_object	same as the Pike function this_object()
	context.program	the program in which this function resides
	current_storage	a 'char *' pointer into the data area for this
	          	object. This is the pointer to the area reserved
	             	for you if you have done add_storage() earlier.
