NAME
	throw - throw an exception

SYNTAX
	#include "error.h"

	int throw(void);

DESCRIPTION
	This function calls longjmp and does all the cleanup and popping
	the Pike stack etc. etc. This function does not setup any error
	message or backtrace like error() does. error() calls this function
	after doing all that. Since this function calls longjmp, it does
	not return. See SETJMP for more details.

KEYWORDS
	internals
