NAME
	types - how to describe types internally

DESCRIPTION
	When describing types to add_function or add_efun you always write
	it in a string. You write the type just as you would in Pike. The
	internal types have a few extra features though. Here is a brief
	explanation of the syntax:

	type             	you write:
	int                 	"int"
	float               	"float"
	string              	"string"
	mapping         	"mapping(mixed:mixed)" or "mapping"
	array of int		"array(int)" or "int *"
	function(int:int)	"function(int:int)"
	varargs function	"function(int ...:int)"
	int or string		"int|string"

	Then there are a few tricks you can use, say you have a function which
	returns an int except if you call it with a string in which case it
	return a string:

	"!function(string:mixed)&function(mixed:int)|function(string:string)"

	The & and ! operators work as you might expect but are only useful
	together.
