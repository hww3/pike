NAME
	error_handling - how to error handling works inside Pike

DESCRIPTION
	Error handling in Pike is implemented with the setjmp/longjmp
	functionality. This means that functions that can cause errors
	will NOT return if an error occurs. Special care has to be taken
	so that no memory is left unfreed if an error occurs. Almost all
	functions that can cause Pike code to be executed can cause an
	error. Also functions that implements Pike operators / functions
	can cause errors. If you are paranoid you should assume that all
	functions can cause errors. You may also read the code for the
	function to see if there are any calls to error() in it. If the
	function is documented in this manual, it will say if the function
	can cause errors.
