NAME
	array_index - get an index from an array

SYNTAX
	#include "array.h"

	void array_index(struct svalue *to, struct array *a, INT32 n);

DESCRIPTION
	This function frees the contents of the svalue 'to' and replaces
	it with a copy of the contents from index 'n' in the array 'a'.
	Basically, what it does is:

		assign_svalue(to, a->item + n);

	The only differance is that it adds some debug and safety
	measures. Usually you don't really need to use this function.

NOTA BENE
	If n is out of bounds (n < 0 or n >= a->size) Pike will dump
	core. If Pike was compiled with DEBUG, a message will be written
	first stating what the problem was.
