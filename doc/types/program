NAME
	program - a class, or blueprint for an object

DESCRIPTION
	There is no syntax example in this file because there is no way to
	write constant programs. (yet) New programs are made with
	compile_file() or compile_string(). Programs are only useful as
	arguments to clone() and the only operators that applies to programs
	are == and !=.

NOTA BENE
	In Pike the term 'program' is somewhat confusing, becuase it is used
	both to reference a complete runnable software package, and to a
	structure in Pike containing code.

KEYWORDS
	types

SEE ALSO
	object, function, builtin/compile_file, builtin/compile_string,
	builtin/clone
