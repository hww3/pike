NAME
	object - an instance of a class (program)

DESCRIPTION
	There is no syntax example in this file because there is no way to
	write constant object. The only way to make new objects is to use
	clone() on a program.

	Here follows a list of operators that applies to objects:
	In this list, o and o2 are used to represent object expressions,
	and s is a string expression:

	o[s]	indexing, returns the identifier named s in the object o,
		an identifier is a global variable or a function.
	o[s]=c	This sets the global variable s int the object o to c,
		if s is a function however, an error is produced.
	o->foo	same as o["foo"]
	o == o2	return 1 if o and o2 are the same object
	o != o2	return 0 if o and o2 are the same object

KEYWORDS
	type
