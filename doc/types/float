NAME
	float - floating point numbers

SYNTAX EXAMPLE
	0.9
	1.0
	2.7e7

DESCRIPTION
	This type stores a floating point number, normally it use 4 bytes
	of storage when used in a global variable.

	A list of operators that applies to floats follows:
	In this list a and b is used to represent a float expression:

	a + b	summation
	a - b	subtraction
	a * b	multiplication
	a / b	division
	a % b	modulo ( same thing as  a - floor( a / b ) * b )
	- a	negation
	a == b	return 1 if a is equal to b, 0 otherwise
	a != b	return 0 if a is equal to b, 1 otherwise
	a < b	returns 1 if a is lesser than b, 0 otherwise
	a <= b	returns 1 if a is lesser or equal to b, 0 otherwise
	a > b	returns 1 if a is greater than b, 0 otherwise
	a >= b	returns 1 if a is greater or equal to b, 0 otherwise

NOTA BENE
	floats and ints cannot be used together, they have to be cast
	to the same type first.
