NAME
	exec - execute a program

SYNTAX
	int exec(string ... args);

DESCRIPTION
	This function transforms the uLPC process into a process running
	the program specified in args. The args will be sent as argv[] to
	the new program. This function only returns if something went wrong
	during exec(), and in that case it returns zero.

NOTA BENE
	The uLPC driver _dies_ when this function is called. You must use
	fork() if you wish to execute a program and still run the uLPC
	driver.

EXAMPLE
	exec("ls","-l");

SEE ALSO
	files/fork, file->pipe
