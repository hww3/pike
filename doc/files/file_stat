NAME
	file_stat - stat a file

SYNTAX
	int *file_stat(string file);
	or
	int *file_stat(string file, 1);
	or
	int *file->stat();

DESCRIPTION
	file_stat returns an array of integers describing some properties
	about the file.	Currently file_stat return 5 entries:
	({
	   mode, /* file mode, protection bits etc. etc. */
	   size, /* file size for regular files,
	          * -2 for dirs,
	          * -3 for links,
	          * -4 for otherwise
	          */
	   atime, /* last access time */
	   mtime, /* last modify time */
	   ctime, /* last status time change */
	   uid,   /* The user who owns this file */
	   gid   /* The group this file belongs to */
	})
	If you give 1 as a second argument, stat does not follow links.
	You can never get -3 as size if you don't give a second argument.

	If there is no such file or directory, zero is returned.
