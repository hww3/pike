NAME
	variables - how to declare a variable

SYNTAX
	modifier type variable_name_list;

DESCRIPTION
	This is how you declare a global variable. Local variables are defined
	in the same way, but you may not use any modifiers for local variables.
	The variable_name_list is a comma separated list of the variables
	to declare as the type 'type'. Note that '*' binds to the variable
	names, not the type. This means that:

		int * i,j;

	Declares i as an array of int, but j will be declared as int. To
	declare both i and j as arrays of int you have to write.

		int * i, * j;

	or

		array(int) i,j;

	Modifiers can be zero or more of: static, no_mask and private.
	Private means that the variable can not be accessed from programs
	that inherit this program. Static means that it can not be accessed
	from other objects with the index operator. No_mask means that it
	can not be redefined in inheriting programs.
