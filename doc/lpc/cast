NAME
	cast - convert one type to another

SYNTAX
	( <type> ) <expression>

DESCRIPTION
	Casts convert types, in most cases it just tells the compiler what
	type the expression has, but it can also be used to actually convert
	the value of the expression into something else.

	Casting from float or int to string will convert the given number
	into a decimal ascii string representation.

	Casting from string to float or int will do the opposite. IE.
	Read a decimal number from the string and return that.

	Casting from string to program will call cast_to_program in the
	master object and request a program to return. The standard master
	object will consider the string a file name and compile the program
	given by that string. It will then put the program in a chache in
	case you cast the same string to a program again later.

	In all other cases, casts are just compiler hints.
