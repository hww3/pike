NAME
	cast - convert one type to another

SYNTAX
	( <type> ) <expression>

DESCRIPTION
	Casts convert types, in most cases it just tells the compiler what
	type the expression has, but it can also be used to actually convert
	the value of the expression into something else.

	Casting from float or int to string will convert the given number
	into a decimal ascii string representation.

	Casting from string to float or int will do the opposite. IE.
	Read a decimal number from the string and return that.

	Casting from string to program will call cast_to_program in the
	master object and request a program to return. The standard master
	object will consider the string a file name and compile the program
	given by that string. It will then put the program in a chache in
	case you cast the same string to a program again later.

	Castring from string to object will call cast_to_object in the
	master object and request an object to return. The standard master
	object will consider the string a file name, cast it to a program
	and return a clone of that file. If the same cast is attempted again
	later, the _same_ object will be returned.

	When casting an object, the method o->cast will be called with a string
	with the name of the type as argument. o->cast can then return any
	value.

	In all other cases, casts are just compiler hints.

EXAMPLES
	(program)"/precompiled/file"	// returns the file program
	(object)"/precompiled/file"	// returns a clone of the file program
	(int)(object)"/precompiled/mpz" // returns 0
