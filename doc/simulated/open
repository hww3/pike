        t -- When write, truncate
        c -- When read or write, if there is no file, try to create one.
        x -- Fail if file already exist (use with 'c')

        One of r or w must always be present.

        The return value is either the file object or false (integer zero).

        string read(int howmuch)
        int write(string what)
        int seek(int whereto)
