NAME
	find_option - find command line options

SYNTAX
	#include <getopt.h>

	mixed find_option(string *argv,
	                  string shortform,
	                  string longform,
	                  string envvar,
	                  mixed def);

DESCRIPTION
	This is a generic function to parse command line options of the
	type '-f', '--foo' or '--foo=bar'. The first argument should be
	the array of strings that is sent as second argument to your
	main() function, the second is a string with the short form of
	your option. The short form must be only one character long.
	The 'longform' is an alternative and maybe more readable way to
	give the same option. If you give "foo" as longform your program
	will accept --foo as argument. The envvar argument specifies what
	environment variable can be used to specify the same option. The
	envvar option exists to make it easier to custimizer program usage.
	The 'def' has two functions: It specifies that the option takes an
	argument and it tells find_option what to return if the option is
	not present. If 'def' is given and the option does not have an
	argument find_option will print an error message and exit the program.

	Also, as an extra bonus: shortform, longform and envvar can all be
	arrays, in which case either of the options in the array will be
	accpted.

NOTA BENE
	find_option modifies argv.

EXAMPLE
	int main(int argc, string *argv)
	{
	  if(find_option(argv,"f","foo"))
            werror("The FOO option was given.\n");

          werror("The BAR option got the "+
	         find_option(argv,"b","bar","BAR_OPTION","default")+
	         " argument.\n");
	}
