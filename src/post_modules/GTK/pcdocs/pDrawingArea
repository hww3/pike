PROGRAM(pDrawingArea); 
INHERIT(drawing_area); 
// A Drawing area with backing store. Basically, the only difference
// from a drawing area widget is that this one never loose it's
// contents unless you do paint over them.
// <p>
// It also use quite a significant amount of memory if the backing
// pixmap has many bitplanes, and the drawing area is large.
