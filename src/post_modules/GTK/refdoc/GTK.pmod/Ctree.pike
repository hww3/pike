//! The GtkCTree widget is used for showing a hierarchical tree to the
//! user, for example a directory tree.
//! 
//! The tree is internally represented as a set of GtkCTreeNode
//! structures.
//! 
//! The interface has much in common with the GtkCList widget: rows
//! (nodes) can be selected by the user etc.
//! 
//! Positions in the tree are often indicated by two arguments, a
//! parent and a sibling, both GtkCTreeNode pointers. If the parent is
//! NULL, the position is at the root of the tree and if the sibling is
//! NULL, it will be the last child of parent, otherwise it will be
//! inserted just before the sibling.
//! 
//!
//!
//!  Signals:
//! @b{change_focus_row_expansion@}
//! Changed when the focused row is either expanded or collapsed
//!
//!
//! @b{tree_collapse@}
//! Called when a node is collapsed
//!
//!
//! @b{tree_expand@}
//! Called when a node is expanded
//!
//!
//! @b{tree_move@}
//! Called when a node is moved (using DND, as an example)
//!
//!
//! @b{tree_select_row@}
//! Called when a node is selected.
//!
//!
//! @b{tree_unselect_row@}
//! Called when a node is unselected.
//!
//!
