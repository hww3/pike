//! Used to create a new vscale widget.
//! The adjustment argument can either be an existing W(Adjustment), or
//! 0, in which case one will be created for you. Specifying 0 might
//! actually be useful in this case, if you wish to pass the newly
//! automatically created adjustment to the constructor function of
//! some other widget which will configure it for you, such as a text
//! widget.
