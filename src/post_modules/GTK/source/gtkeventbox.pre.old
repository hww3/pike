// Some gtk widgets don't have associated X windows, so they just draw
// on their parents. Because of this, they cannot recieve events and
// if they are incorrectly sized, they don't clip so you can get messy
// overwritting etc. If you require more from these widgets, the
// EventBox is for you.
//<p>
// At first glance, the EventBox widget might appear to be totally
// useless. It draws nothing on the screen and responds to no
// events. However, it does serve a function - it provides an X window
// for its child widget. This is important as many GTK widgets do not
// have an associated X window. Not having an X window saves memory
// and improves performance, but also has some drawbacks. A widget
// without an X window cannot receive events, and does not perform any
// clipping on it's contents. Although the name EventBox emphasizes
// the event-handling function, the widget can also be used for
// clipping.
//<p>
// The primary use for this widget is when you want to receive events
// for a widget without a window. Examples of such widgets are labels
// and images.
