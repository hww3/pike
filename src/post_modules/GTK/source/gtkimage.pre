// on it's background. It will not make the container transparent, though.
// Use shape_combine_mask on the container with the mask for that.

// There is no need to call 'set' with the same GDK.Image again if
// you have modified the image. You must, however, use -&gt;queue_draw()
// to redraw the image. Otherwise the old contens will be shown until
// an refresh of the widget is done for any other reason.
