//! Together with W(Plug), GTK2.Socket provides the ability to embed
//! widgets from one process into another process in a fashion that is
//! transparent to the user. One process creates a GTK2.Socket widget
//! and, passes the XID of that widget's window to the other process,
//! which then creates a W(Plug) window with that XID. Any widgets
//! contained in the W(Plug) then will appear inside the first
//! applications window.
//! <p>
//! Note that if you pass the XID of the socket to another process
//! that will create a plug in the socket, you must make sure that the
//! socket widget is not destroyed until that plug is
//! created. Violating this rule will cause unpredictable
//! consequences, the most likely consequence being that the plug will
//! appear as a separate toplevel window.
//! </p><p>
//!  A socket can also be used to swallow arbitrary pre-existing
//!  top-level windows using steal(), though the integration when this
//!  is done will not be as close as between a W(Plug) and a
//!  GTK2.Socket.
