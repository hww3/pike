class GTK2.Tooltips;
inherit GTK2.Data;

//! Tooltips are the messages that appear next to a widget when the
//! mouse pointer is held over it for a short amount of time. They are
//! especially helpful for adding more verbose descriptions of things
//! such as buttons in a toolbar.
//! <p>
//! An individual tooltip belongs to a group of tooltips. A group is
//! created with a call to GTK2.Tooltips(). Every tooltip in the
//! group can then be turned off with a call to disable()
//! and enabled with enable().</p>
//! <p>
//! The length of time the user must keep the mouse over a widget
//! before the tip is shown, can be altered with set_delay(). This is
//! set on a 'per group of tooltips' basis.</p>
//! <p>
//! To assign a tip to a particular W(Widget), set_tip() is used.</p>
//! <p>
//! The default appearance of all tooltips in a program is determined
//! by the current gtk theme that the user has selected. To change the
//! tooltip appearance manually, use set_colors(). Again, this is per
//! group of tooltips.</p>

void create();
//! Creates an empty group of tooltips. This function initialises a
//! GTK2.Tooltips structure. Without at least one such structure, you
//! can not add tips to your application.

void enable();
//! Enable this tooltip collection.

void disable();
//! Disable this tooltip collection.

void set_tip(GTK2.Widget in, string to, null);
//! Adds a tooltip containing the message tip_text to the specified
//! W(Widget).

void force_window();
//! Realize the tooltip window (as returned from get_gdkwindow())
