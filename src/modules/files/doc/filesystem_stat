DESCRIPTION
        filesystem_stat returns a mapping describing some properties
        about the filesystem.
        Currently nine fields of the mapping are defined:

	([
	  "blocksize":int,      /* filesystem block size */
          "blocks":int,         /* total # of blocks on file system
                                 * in units of blocksize */
          "bfree":int,          /* total # of free blocks */
          "bavail":int,         /* total # of free blocks
                                 * available to non-super-user */
          "files":int,          /* total # of files */
          "ffree":int,          /* total # of free files */
          "favail":int,         /* total # of free files
                                 * available to non-super-user */
          "fstype":string       /* target fs type name */
          "fsname":string       /* target fs name */
        }) 
        
        If there is no such file or directory, zero is returned.
