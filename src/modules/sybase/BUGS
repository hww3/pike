# BUGS file for the sybase driver

While this could not be traced to a fault in the driver, we were reported
memory leaks when running multi-threaded under Linux with 
Sybase ASE 11.9.2.

The possible explanation is that while the linux libraries are thread-safe,
they're not thread-hot (this is sybase's saying, not ours). Until better
checks are implemented (see the TODO file), refrain from using this driver
in a multi-threaded fashion unless the reentrant libraries can be found on
your system (i.e. /opt/sybase/lib/libtcl_r.so).

Due to the design of the sybase interface, some SQL-interface methods are
not implemented, you'll get exceptions when trying to use those. This
driver however behaves mostly nicely when used with the Sql.sql interface.

Also, due to the uniqueness of the sybase interface design, it is NOT
possible to have multiple pending results for the same connection. Kludging
around this would be very dangerous in terms of memory consumption (it
would require fetching the whole results-set before issuing the new query)
that it won't be done.

Another current limitation of the current implementation is that it lacks a
cancel method. This means, if you wish to issue a query, you must have
fetched all the rows for the previous one.
