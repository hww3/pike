# TODO file for the sybase pike driver
# by Francesco Chemolli
# $Id$

Improve the checks for the sybase-libraries, and use a lock to serialize
all accesses unless the reentrant (thread-hot) libraries are found. This
could solve the memory leaks experienced when running multi-threaded on
Linux.

Re-implement the whole show, with better wrappers. Remove most logic from
the C module in favor of the pike module, and move towards a more standard
big_query approach (with a separate pike module for the
result-object). This will allow for better emulation of the other drivers.
