NAME
	chroot - change the root directory

SYNTAX
	int chroot(string newroot);
	or
	int chroot(object(File) obj);

DESCRIPTION
	Changes the root directory for this process to the indicated
	directory.

NOTA BENE
	Since this function modifies the directory structure as seen from
	Pike, you have to modify the environment variables PIKE_MODULE_PATH
	and PIKE_INCLUDE_PATH to compensate for the new root-directory.

	This function only exists on systems that have the chroot(2)
	system call.
	The second variant only works on systems that also have
	the fchroot(2) system call.
