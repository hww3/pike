There is also (antialiased) fonts for writing.

<h2>Notable features and ideas</h2>

Replace your headlines with nice images? With shading? Easy done in a
roxen module. <br>

Wan't cool animations, calculated from time or other sources? Like the
klockmäster watch. Been there?<br>

Need to do some heavy matrix operations, rotating, scaling, cosine
transform? Done that. :)

<h2>Yet do be done</h2>
