We have not written up the code for all these crypto algorithms by
ourselves. There are plenty of implementations floating around on the net,
some in the public domain, others covered by the GNU General Public
License. We have assembled, tested and adapted this code, but most of
the work was done by to those who carefully coded and optimized the
implementations.

idea.c     Original implementation by Xuejia Lai, heavily optimized by
           Colin Plumb. In the Public Domain (although the algorithm
           itself is patented)

sha.c      Written by Peter Gutmann, somewhat hacked by Andrew
           Kuchling. Public Domain.

md5.c      Written by Colin Plumb. Also hacked by Andrew Kuchling.

descore    Written by Dana L. How. GPL.

cast.c     Written by Steve Reid <sreid@sea-to-sky.net>. Public Domain.
