	  undefined behaviour, now it works.

	* svalue.c (copy_svalues_recursively_no_free): Changed
	  (*to=*from).u.refs[0]++; to *to=*from; from->u.refs[0]++;
          because hp-cc didn't handle the first case. 

Sun Oct 22 22:50:49 1995  Fredrik Hubinette  <hubbe@sparky.signum.se>

	* svalue.c (assign_from_short_svalue_no_free): Moved

          array(int) when given an array(string|zero) if first
	  index was zero.

          free(0) sometimes..
	* modules/files/file.c: fixed a missing ; in the simulated
	  socketpair().

Thu Oct 19 12:48:58 1995  Fredrik Hubinette  <hubbe@freeone.signum.se>

	* interpret.c (strict_apply_svalue): Moved fix to a bug
	  to apply_svalue, so I don't cause a new bug.
	  (void functions left droppings on the stack)

Thu Oct 12 22:33:26 1995  Fredrik Hubinette  <hubbe@sparky.signum.se>

	* v1.0E-15 Released
