Code generation templates for Pike.

These paired files should all implement the following functions/macros:

PIKE_OPCODE_T
	Type with opcode granularity. This is defined in ../program.h.

PIKE_OPCODE_T *PROG_COUNTER;
	Return the current program counter.

void ins_pointer(INT32 ptr);
	Store a 32bit pointer at the current offset.

INT32 read_pointer(INT32 off);
	Read a 32bit pointer from the specified offset.

void upd_pointer(INT32 off, INT32 ptr);
	Store a 32bit pointer at the specified offset.

INT32 LOW_GET_JUMP(void);
	Extract a 32bit pointer from PROG_COUNTER.

void LOW_SKIPJUMP(void);
	Advance PROG_COUNTER past a 32bit pointer.

void ins_align(INT32 align);
	Align the current offset to the specified alignment.

void ins_byte(INT32 val);
	Insert an 8bit unsigned value at the current offset.

void ins_data(INT32 val);
	Insert a 32bit value at the current offset.

void ins_f_byte(unsigned int op);
	Insert the opcode 'op' at the current offset.

void ins_f_byte_with_arg(unsigned int op, unsigned INT32 arg);
	Insert the opcode 'op' with the primary argument 'arg' at
	the current offset.

void ins_f_byte_with_2_args(unsigned int op,
			    unsigned INT32 arg1,
			    unsigned INT32 arg2);
	Insert the opcode 'op' with the primary argument 'arg1' and
	the secondary argument 'arg2' at the current offset.

void UPDATE_PC(void)
	Insert code to update Pike_fp->pc to the current position.

INT32 READ_INCR_BYTE(PIKE_OPCODE_T *pc);
	Return the byte stored at 'pc' by ins_byte(), and increment
	'pc' to the next legal position.

Optional macros:

void CALL_MACHINE_CODE(PIKE_OPCODE_T *pc)
	Start execution of the machine-code located at 'pc'.
	NOTE: This macro does not return, but instead contains
	code that returns from the calling context. The value
	returned in the macro should be one of -1 (inter return),
	or -2 (inter escape catch).

void EXIT_MACHINE_CODE()
	Clean up from CALL_MACHINE_CODE.

void SET_PROG_COUNTER(PIKE_OPCODE_T *newpc)
	Set PROG_COUNTER to a new value.

DEF_PROG_COUNTER;
	Declare stuff needed for PROG_COUNTER.

int PIKE_OPCODE_ALIGN;
	Alignment restriction for PIKE_OPCODE_T (debug).

void INS_ENTRY(void)
	Mark the entry point from eval_instruction().
	Useful to add startup code.

int ENTRY_PROLOGUE_SIZE
	Size (in opcodes) of the prologue to be skipped if tail-recursing.

void RELOCATE_program(struct program *p, PIKE_OPCODE_T *new);
	Relocate the copy of 'p'->program at 'new' to be able
	to execute at the new position.

void FLUSH_INSTRUCTION_CACHE(void *addr, size_t len);
	Flush the memory at 'addr' from the instruction cache.

void ENCODE_PROGRAM(struct program *p, struct dynamic_buffer_s *buf);
	Encode 'p'->program in a way accepted by DECODE_PROGRAM().
	NOTE: The encoded data MUST have the length p->num_program *
	      sizeof(PIKE_OPCODE_T).

void DECODE_PROGRAM(struct program *p)
	Decode 'p'->program as encoded by ENCODE_PROGRAM().
	NOTE: 'p'->relocations is valid at this point.

void FLUSH_CODE_GENERATOR_STATE(void)
        Called at labels and beginning of functions to notify
	the code generator that registers and other states
	must be updated at this point.

void ADJUST_PIKE_PC(PIKE_OPCODE_T *pc)
	Called after opcodes that modify Pike_fp->pc. The passed
	argument is the pc they will put there. Useful when UPDATE_PC
	inserts code that update Pike_fp->pc relatively.

int ALIGN_PIKE_JUMPS
        This can be defined to a number which will cause Pike to
	insert zeroes in the code after instructions which do not
        return to permit better alignment of code. Please note that
        this is not guaranteed and should only be used for optimization.

int ALIGN_PIKE_FUNCTION_BEGINNINGS
	Similar to ALIGN_PIKE_JUMPS, but only for the beginning
        of a function.

int INS_F_JUMP(unsigned int op)
        Similar to ins_f_byte, but is is only called for jump instructions.
        The return value should be the offset in the program to the
        empty address field of the jump instruction. You can also return
        -1 to make the code use the same behaviour as if INS_F_JUMP was
        not defined.    

void UPDATE_F_JUMP(INT32 offset, INT32 to_offset)
        If you define INS_F_JUMP you must also define UPDATE_F_JUMP.
        UPDATE_F_JUMP is called when the compiler knows where to jump.
        (See ia32.c for an example of this and INS_F_JUMP)

INT32 READ_F_JUMP(INT32 offset)
	If you define INS_F_JUMP you must also define READ_F_JUMP.
	READ_F_JUMP is called when the compiler needs to read back the
	to_offset that was passed to UPDATE_F_JUMP.

int INS_F_JUMP_WITH_ARG(unsigned int op, unsigned INT32 arg)
	Similar to INS_F_JUMP(), but called for jump instructions
	that take a parameter.

int INS_F_JUMP_WITH_TWO_ARGS(unsigned int op,	 
			     unsigned INT32 arg1,
			     unsigned INT32 arg2)
	Similar to INS_F_JUMP(), but called for jump instructions
	that take two parameters.

void CHECK_RELOC(size_t reloc, size_t program_size)
	Check if a relocation is valid for the program.
	Should throw an error on bad relocations.

OPCODE_INLINE_BRANCH
	If defined test functions that return non zero if the branch
	is to be taken will be generated for I_BRANCH instructions.
	This is to facilitate easier inlining of branches in the
	machine code.

void DISASSEMBLE_CODE(void *adrr, size_t bytes)
	Debug function that dumps the generated code on stderr.
