PIKE 0.5 - a longer lists of arguments

/*
Learn about Pike, the language that lies among the reeds, just waiting
to use its big jaws to swallow both problems and problem solvers, and
thus staying at the top of the food chain.
*/

o Pike is an easy programming language to learn. Just as easily Pike lets you
  develop powerful applications. Pike is designed to be used.

o Although Pike is a scripting language it is designed to generate
  very fast code. 

o Pike is readable *and* looks like C.

o If you write large applications, you can write your own Pike-modules
  in C, and this makes the code both more transparent and faster.

Arguments for the Pike language:
	+ General Purpose Programming Language
	+ Free! It's not just free to use it. You may also modify the
	  code and use it. See more details at http://pike.idonex.se/GPL.html
	+ A nice up-to-date manual on the web
	+ Makes it possible to write multithreaded programs.
	+ Easy to write programs that listen to ports and other networking 
	  Functions. 
	+ Source Code Available - To promote use and sharing of useful code
	+ Portable- Platform independent available on most flavors of Unix
	+ C-like Syntax - Easy to learn
	+ Powerful - High-level language, short code
	+ Object Oriented - easy to use and allows multiple
	  developer cooperation
	+ Modular - Extendible with modules e.g. written in C
	+ Interpreted, which mean no long compiling and linking time.
	  Just program and run! And there will be no core dumbs...
	+ Iterative language
	+ Incremental - allows on-the-fly modifications and recompilations
	+ Powerful Data Types that are well-scaling
	+ Automatic Memory Management
	+ Scalable - as useful for small scripts as for powerful
	  and complex applications.
	+ Text Processing - e.g. for filters
	+ Exception Handling
	+ The lovely green color of its home page.
	+ Optimized, Faster than Perl, Python (and Java)
	+ Faster development than C, C++

	- No Pike compiler or debugger
	- Limited image format import options
	- Not optimal for heavy numeric processing jobs
 	- Not for GUI based applications
	- Few special effect image filters
	- Not tried for embedded product applications. Why don't you be
	  the first one!

Applications that have been made with Pike
	+ Network Applications - Client/Server applications,
	  e.g. the Roxen Challenger Web-server and the Jukebox
	+ System Administration Tools & Utilities - even as quick one-shots
	+ Possible to use for CGI programming
	+ Real-time client-server status monitor
	+ Custom mail gateways
	+ adduser or adddomain scripts that setup users/domains 
	+ implementations of client-server protocols
	+ (complex) string / parsing operations.
	+ MUDs


Arguments for some of the Pike modules:

IMAGE - Image Processing Tool

Image processing, for filters, cut & paste and text rendering. 
Input formats: ppm
Output formats: ppm, gif 

This package is fast, easy to use and have anti-aliasing on many
functions. It also makes it possible to write text with various fonts
in your images.


DB API - Database Application Programming Interface

Makes it possible to use SQL-databases in your Pike-application.


MIME - Multimedia Internet Mail Extension

To pack and unpack mails bundled and easy to use.


CRYPTO - Cryptographic toolkit

Enables easy development of secure applications.


Regexp - A module for Regular Expression

A regular expression is a standardized way to make pattern that match
certain strings. In Pike you can often use the sscanf, range and index
operators to match strings, but sometimes a regexp is both faster and
easier.


Gz - compressing files

Note: This module is not compatible with gzip, but it will be in the
future.


Getopt - find command line options

Makes it easier to parse command line options.


Gmp - very large numbers

This makes it possible to use as big integers as you have memory.


Yp - an interface to the Yellow Pages functions. 

YP is most commonly used to distribute passwords and similar
information within a network


Foo - The module that you are about to write

It will be able to show a 45 inch window on a 14 inch screen, It will
work as a combined communications satellite and Wunderbaum.  It has to
be able to cure deadly diseases and make your teeth whiter while you
sleep. And it shall travel through time! And it will have a telepathic
user interface!
*Tock* *Spoff*
Or it might just as well be made to show some fishes on your screen.
