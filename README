HOW TO BUILD PIKE

If you are building Pike from the CVS, read README-CVS instead.

The top-level makefile (in this directory, not the src directory) has
all the magic you need to build Pike. Just type 'make'.
To install type "make install" or "make install_interactive".

You will need gnu m4, bison and a C compiler. You probably also want
to use GNU make and libz.

If that doesn't work, refer to README-CVS, in particular the sections
on additional "DEPENDENCIES", on "CONFIGURE OPTIONS AND BUILD VARIABLES",
on "MANUAL BUILDING" and, if needed, the section "IF IT DOESN'T WORK".


BUGS

If you find a bug in the interpreter, the first thing to do is to make
sure the interpreter is compiled with PIKE_DEBUG defined.  If not,
recompile with PIKE_DEBUG and see if you get another error.  When
you've done this, please report the bug to us at
http://community.roxen.com/crunch/ and include as much as you can
muster of the following:

  o The version of the driver. (Try pike --version or look in
    src/version.h)
  o What kind of system hardware/software you use (OS, compiler, etc.)
  o The piece of code that crashes or bugs, preferably in a very
    small Pike-script with the bug isolated.  Please send a complete
    running example of something that makes the interpreter bug.
  o A description of what it is that bugs and when.
  o If you know how, then also give us a backtrace and dump of vital
    variables at the point of crash.
  o Or, if you found the error and corrected it, just send us the
    bugfix along with a description of what you did and why.
