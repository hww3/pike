Changes since Pike 7.6:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o Stdio.*
  Stdio.cp can now works recursively in a directory tree
  Stdio.cp now keep permissions when copying
  Added Stdio.recursive_mv which work on every OS and when destination isn't 
  on the same filesystem as the source

o Process.popen
   Process.popen is now able to run in nonblocking mode. If a second
   argument is provided a file object will be opened witht that mode
   and return, enabling for two way communication with the new
   process.

o PIKE_PORTABLE_BYTECODE
   --with-portable-bytecode is now the default. Pike programs that have
   been dumped on one architecture now can be decoded on another.
