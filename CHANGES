Changes since Pike 7.4:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New/improved functionality:
---------------------------

o rsif
    rsif can now work recursively in a file structure if given the
    flag -r or --recursive. Example:
      pike -x rsif -r 7.4 7.6

o The automatic garbage collection strategy is configurable
    The garbage collector can be configured to take both the amount of
    garbage and the cpu time spent in the gc into account. Automatic
    gc runs can also be disabled in critical regions. See the function
    Pike.gc_parameters.

o sort() is stable
    Unlike previous releases, sort() will keep the original order
    between elements that are equal. This was not implemented as a
    separate function since it could be done with virtually no extra
    overhead.

o sort() is portable
    Sort is now locale and platform independent. In other words,
    strings are now compared only according to the unicode value of
    every character.

o Reworked codec
    The codec for serialization of Pike data types has been updated
    and has a significally improved successrate at encoding modules.


Language additions:
-------------------


New modules / classes / methods added:
--------------------------------------

o trace() takes another argument to turn on tracing in all threads
    The configure option --without-thread-trace has been removed, but
    instead the trace() function has been extended to make it possible
    to set the trace level in all threads simultaneously.

o Regexp.PCRE added to give libpcre support

Optimizations:
--------------

o Instantiation and destruction of pike-classes is now significantly faster.

o Handling of bignums has been optimized, especially conversion
  to/from normal integers.
