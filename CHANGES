Changes since Pike 7.2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New functionality:
------------------

o New Hilfe

o pike -x
    rsif
    pv

o unbug


New concepts:
-------------

o Automap

o Implicit lambda.

o global::
    Added new keyword global to be able to access identifiers on the
    top level of the compilation unit using global::foo. (Deactivated
    in 7.2 compatibility mode, of course.)

    It's now possible to use e.g: global::this_program. 

    Added an optional level argument to this_object(). *FIXME: Do we
    really want this documented?*
    

o this
    Added a magic identifier "this" that can be used instead of
    this_object(). Like this_program, it only exists when there's no
    other identifier with that name. The object of a surrounding class
    can be adressed with Foo::this.

o Local

o Iterators  (Mapping.pmod Multiset.pmod)

o for(X; Y; Z)

o enum reserved

o enum and typedef have implicit local binding

o ::_indices ::_values

o Sooo.... This would be what?
    Include the names of the surrounding classes themselves in the lookup for
    Foo::, to make it possible to adress hidden variables in the scopes of
    surrounding classes, e.g:

       class X {
         int i;
         void create (int i) {X::i = i;}
       }
    
    Since this change is mostly but not completely compatible with the earlier
    lookup rule, it's disabled in 7.2 compatibility mode.

Other:
------

sp -> Pike_sp
fp -> Pike_fp
fatal -> Pike_fatal
empty_string -> empty_pike_string

--with-internal-profiling
--with-new-multisets



New modules / classes / methods added:
--------------------------------------

o ADT.History
    Alfons Åberg.

o ADT.Relation.Binary
    Handles binary relations.
   
o Audio.Codec and Audio.Codec
    Contains decoders and encoders for audio. Currently WAV and MP3.

o Calendar.verify

o Debug.Tracer

o Locale.Language

o Parser.Python

o Parser.RCS
    

o XML.NSTree

o HTTP.Server

o X.KeySums

o Standards.CIFF

o Standards.FIPS10_4

o Standards.ID3

o Standards.RDF

o Stdio.FakeFile

o Stdio.GZipFile

o Tools.PV
    Convenience tool that sets up a canvas with GTK, presents a
    picture on it and delivers a number of image inspection and
    manipulation options. 

    Also accessable via "pike -x pv"
    
o Image.Dims
    Can extract the dimensions of an image withóut loading the entire
    image.

o Image.Fonts
    High level API for font handling. Should be used instead of
    accessing the Freetype, TTF and *FIXME* modules directly.

o Image.DWG
    AutoCAD thumbnail images.

o Gmp.mpq and Gmp.mpf
    Multi precision fractions.    
   
Optimizations:
--------------

o Improvement and bug tickets closed: 1499


Compatibility changes:
----------------------

Bugfixes and API-fixes that break compatibility. The old behaviour is
emulated in the compatibility layer that is activated by adding the
preprocessor directive "#pike 7.2" to your program or by precifying
the "-V7.2" argument to the pike executable.

o Protocols.LDAP.client
    The return code from all methods was changed to follow Pike's
    logic better. 0 is now a failure. The old behaviour is emulated in
    compatibility layer

o dirname
    Now correctly returns a directory instead of just stripping the
    part after nearest directory seprator.

o LR
    LR has been moved to Parser.LR and the API has been chnged.
    FIXME: More about this?


Bugs fixed:
-----------

o Reworked trampolines to cause less circular references. (solves 1937)
