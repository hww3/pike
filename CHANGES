Changes since Pike 7.6:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o New syntax to index from the end in range operations.
  A "<" can be added before an index in the [..] operator to count
  from the end instead. This is convenient to e.g. chop off the last
  element in an array: a[..<1].

o New `[..] operator function.
  Range operations have been separated from the `[] operator function
  and is handled by a new `[..] which provides greater control in how
  the range bounds are specified. For compatibility, if there is no
  `[..] then `[] is still called for range operations.

o Stdio.*
  Stdio.cp can now work recursively in a directory tree.
  Stdio.cp now keeps permissions when copying.
  Added Stdio.recursive_mv which works on every OS and also when the
  destination isn't on the same filesystem as the source.

o Process.popen
   Process.popen is now able to run in nonblocking mode. If a second
   argument is provided a file object will be opened with that mode
   and return, enabling two way communication with the new process.

o bin/precompile.pike
   Voidable pointer types are no longer promoted to mixed.

o PIKE_PORTABLE_BYTECODE
   --with-portable-bytecode is now the default. Pike programs that have
   been dumped on one architecture now can be decoded on another.

o Math.Matrix 
  Multiplication were bugged and gave B*A instead of A*B. Now fixed.
