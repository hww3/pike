New concepts:
-------------

o foreach(X; Y; Z)
    The foreach statement has been extended to allow iterations over
    mappings, multisets and any object that implements the iterator
    interface (see below). To make it possible to use this
    conveniently, a new syntax has been added to get both the index
    and the value in each iteration:

    	foreach (something; index-expr; value-expr) ...

    This iterates over something, assigning in turn each index to
    index-expr and each value to value-expr. The index and value
    expressions can be declarations or lvalues, and they can also be
    left out if the index and/or value part isn't interesting.

    Note that it depends on the data type whether the iteration order
    is well defined or not; arrays and multisets are iterated over
    starting with the first element while mappings are visited in some
    arbitrary order (each element is still visited only once, though).

o Iterators
    As noted above, an iterator interface has been added that is now
    used in various places to iterate over different data structures.
    Not only the built-in data types are supported, but actually any
    object that fulfills the interface for iterators:

    When iterating over an object o, o->_get_iterator() is called to
    get an iterator object. It should at least have two functions
    index() and value() to get the index and value at the current
    position, a function `+=(int steps) to advance the current
    position the specified number of steps, and a `!() that returns
    zero if the position hasn't reached the end of the data set.

    Also, if the object o lacks a _get_iterator function, it's assumed
    to be an iterator itself. This makes it possible to pass an
    iterator explicitly to e.g. the foreach statement.

    The built-in data types also have iterator classes with this
    interface. They are found as Array.Iterator, Mapping.Iterator, etc
    and can be used to iterate over these data types in some custom
    fashion. This is especially useful for mappings and multisets,
    which cannot be iterated over directly in any other way. For
    example, to get some arbitrary index in a mapping m:

	mixed any_index = Mapping.Iterator(m)->index();

o Automap

o Implicit lambda.

o Access to hidden variables in surrounding scopes.
    Include the names of the surrounding classes themselves in the lookup for
    Foo::, to make it possible to adress hidden variables in the scopes of
    surrounding classes, e.g:

       class Foo {
         int i;
	 void create (int i) {Foo::i = i;}
       }

o global::
    Added new keyword global to be able to access identifiers on the
    top level of the compilation unit using global::foo.

o global.
    All top level modules (and other identifiers in that scope) can now
    be accessed with a "global." prefix. This is useful in cases where
    local identifiers overshadow the top level, for instance in the Image
    module, where the Image.Image class would occasionally block your view.

o this
    Added a magic identifier "this" that can be used instead of
    this_object(). Like this_program, it only exists when there's no
    other identifier with that name. The primary reason for adding
    this magic identifier is to make it possible to address the object
    of a surrounding class with Foo::this.

o The Local module

o enum reserved

o enum and typedef have implicit local binding

o ::_indices(), ::_values().
   There are now two "magic" functions ::_indices() and ::_values()
   that can be used by an object to list all identifiers and their
   values in itself. They are primarily intended when the _indices()
   and _values() lfuns have been defined, to get the default
   implementations. This is to complement the "magic" ::`->() and
   ::`->=() functions that exist in earlier releases.

Compatibility changes:
----------------------

The following changes are known to break compatibility. The old
behaviour is emulated in the compatibility layer that is activated by
adding the preprocessor directive "#pike 7.2" to your program or by
giving the argument "-V7.2" to the pike executable.

o "global" has become a reserved keyword.

o Changed lookup rule for ::.
    Previously the identifier in front of :: was only looked up among
    the preceding inherits. Now the lookup additionally includes the
    names of the surrounding classes. The inherits inside a class
    still take precedence over the name of the class, though.

o Using local:: on variables is an error.
    Previously the construct local::foo could be used to access the
    identifier "foo" in the class scope if it had been overridden by
    an argument or function variable. That is however only a
    side-effect of the real use for local::, namely to bind the
    identifier statically at that point only, to avoid getting an
    overridden version. In the case of variables this leads to
    questionable semantics, which is the reason it's been made an
    error in this version. Pike 7.2 didn't implement it correctly;
    there local:: on variables had only the effect to access the class
    scope. Now a proper way to access hidden identifiers has been
    added, so all such uses of local:: should be replaced with
    this_program::.

o Protocols.LDAP.client
    The return code from all methods was changed to follow Pike's
    logic better. 0 is now a failure. The old behaviour is emulated in
    compatibility layer

o dirname
    Now correctly returns a directory instead of just stripping the
    part after nearest directory seprator.

o LR
    LR has been moved to Parser.LR and the API has been chnged.
    FIXME: More about this?


Bugs fixed:
-----------

o Reworked trampolines to cause less circular references. (solves 1937)
