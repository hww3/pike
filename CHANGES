Changes since Pike 7.4:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

New/improved functionality:
---------------------------

o rsif
    rsif can now work recursively in a file structure if given the
    flag -r or --recursive. Example:
      pike -x rsif -r 7.4 7.6

o The automatic garbage collection strategy is configurable
    The garbage collector can be configured to take both the amount of
    garbage and the cpu time spent in the gc into account. See the
    function Pike.gc_parameters.


Language additions:
-------------------


New modules / classes / methods added:
--------------------------------------

o trace() takes another argument to turn on tracing in all threads
    The configure option --without-thread-trace has been removed, but
    instead the trace() function has been extended to make it possible
    to set the trace level in all threads simultaneously.


Optimizations:
--------------

o Instantiation and destruction of pike-classes is now significantly faster.
