 * Object variables
 */

//. + nonterminal
//.   Non-terminal this rule reduces to.
int nonterminal;

//. + symbols
//.   The actual rule
array(string|int) symbols;

//. + action
//.   Action to do when reducing this rule.
//.   function - call this function.
//.   string - call this function by name in the object given to the parser.
//.   The function is called with arguments corresponding to the values of
//.   the elements of the rule. The return value of the function will be
//.   the value of this non-terminal. The default rule is to return the first
//.   argument.

//.   This rule contains tokens

//. + num_nonnullables
//.   This rule has this many non-nullable symbols at the moment.

*/

//. + number
//.   Sequence number of this rule (used for conflict resolving)
//.   Also used to identify the rule.
int number = 0;

//. + pri
//.   Priority and associativity of this rule.

/*
 * Functions
 */

//. - create
//.   Create a BNF rule.
//. EXAMPLE:
//.   The rule
//. 
//.	   rule : nonterminal ":" symbols ";" { add_rule };
//. 
//.   might be created as
//. 
//.	   rule(4, ({ 9, ";", 5, ";" }), "add_rule");
//. 
//.   where 4 corresponds to the nonterminal "rule", 9 to "nonterminal"
//.   and 5 to "symbols", and the function "add_rule" is too be called
//.   when this rule is reduced.
//. > nt
//.   Non-terminal to reduce to.
//. > r
//.   Symbol sequence that reduces to nt.
//. > a
//.   Action to do when reducing according to this rule.
//.   function - Call this function.
//.   string - Call this function by name in the object given to the parser.
//.   The function is called with arguments corresponding to the values of
//.   the elements of the rule. The return value of the function will become
//.   the value of this non-terminal. The default rule is to return the first
//.   argument.
